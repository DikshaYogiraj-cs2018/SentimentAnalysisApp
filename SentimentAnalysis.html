/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>array([&#39;Petter Mattei\&#39;s &#34;Love in the Time of Money&#34; is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler\&#39;s play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is good under Mr. Mattei\&#39;s direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.&#39;,
       &#34;This show was an amazing, fresh &amp; innovative idea in the 70&#39;s when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it&#39;s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest-hosts, this show probably wouldn&#39;t still be on the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand-selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s still on the air.&#34;,
       &#34;Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I&#39;ve seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it&#39;s awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, &#39;acting,&#39; soundtrack (the film&#39;s only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.&#34;,
       ...,
       &#39;Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, idiotic directing, the annoying porn groove soundtrack that ran continually over the overacted script, and a crappy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. Trust me, because I stuck this turkey out to the end. It was so pathetically bad all over that I had to figure it was a fourth-rate spoof of Springtime for Hitler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only faint spark of interest, and that was only because she could sing better than the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch something similar but a thousand times better, then watch Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.&#39;,
       &#39;I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school &amp; college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a &#34;good Catholic&#34; in the church\&#39;s eyes because I don\&#39;t believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary\&#39;s emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student\&#39;s mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today\&#39;s Islam, and yesterday\&#39;s Judaism and Christianity.&#39;,
       &#34;No one expects the Star Trek movies to be high art, but the fans do expect a movie that is as good as some of the best episodes. Unfortunately, this movie had a muddled, implausible plot that just left me cringing - this is by far the worst of the nine (so far) movies. Even the chance to watch the well known characters interact in another movie can&#39;t save this movie - including the goofy scenes with Kirk, Spock and McCoy at Yosemite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this movie is not worth a rental, and hardly worth watching, however for the True Fan who needs to see all the movies, renting this movie is about the only way you&#39;ll see it - even the cable channels avoid this movie.&#34;],

<pre>[&#39; petter mattei love in the time of money is visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us vivid portrait about human relations this is movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter br br this being variation on the arthur schnitzler play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat br br the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter br br the acting is good under mr mattei direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive br br we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work &#39;,
 &#39; this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70 when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and it continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today br br it truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts this show probably wouldn still be on the air find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity felt must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such huge success as it is now the show is just awful can believe it still on the air &#39;,
 &#39; encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ve seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the film only song lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have been so happy to see the end credits of film br br the only thing that prevents me giving this 1 score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only &#39;,
 &#39; so im not big fan of boll work but then again not many are enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished br br people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller br br three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how he not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in first person perspective so we don really know what he looked like when he was kicking br br however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods we haven even gone far before started to cry mehehe cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck br br there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse that poop for you simpletons from fa if you wanna take wiff go ahead btw carver gets very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he on screen &#39;,
 &#39; some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in trade off for snazzier special effects again will say that in and of itself it is not bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more &#39;,
 &#39; after the success of die hard and it sequels it no surprise really that in the 1990s glut of die hard on movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallone career br br cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all it full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get out acted by horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it actually very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs br br you ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travers br br he may of been henry in portrait of serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for cringe worthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely can be it really does look like ralph waite frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death br br mention too must go to former london burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes cropper whilst using hal as human football yes you can help enjoy that bit hal needed good kicking br br so forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you re looking for qaulen he the one wearing the helicopter &#39;,
 &#39; had the terrible misfortune of having to view this movie in it entirety br br all have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst movie of all time it shouldn even be called b movie more like an movie because it fails in all aspects that make good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it almost funny almost br br the movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit br br this movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserably br br even some of the most ridiculous movies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch &#39;,
 &#39; first of all let get few things straight here i am an anime fan always has been as matter of fact used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool i do like several movies because they re hilarious i like the godzilla movies lot br br moving on when the movie first comes on it seems like it going to be your usual movie down to the crappy fx but all sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill br br the animation is very bad cheap even worse than what remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact it so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie vividly remember is when bunch of kids run out of school it the same kids over over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voices especially the english dub that viewed was horrid was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots joel mike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same time br br heck m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for b movie night because it stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time m giving this movie 3 10 an improvement from the 0 5 10 was originally going to give it br br according to my grading scale 3 10 means pretty much both boring bad as fun as counting to three unless you find way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to 15 &#39;,
 &#39; this was the worst movie saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film it great to see beals but she only in the movie for few minutes parker is much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story movie revolving about an actor who can get work doesn feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straight to video movies saw back in the 90s and not even good one in those standards br br &#39;,
 &#39; the karen carpenter story shows little more about singer karen carpenter complex life though it fails in giving accurate facts and details br br cynthia gibb portrays karen was not fine election she is good actress but plays very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter think that the role needed stronger character someone with stronger personality br br louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific she does great job as karen mother br br it has great songs which could have been included in soundtrack album unfortunately they weren though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries &#39;,
 &#39; the cell is an exotic masterpiece dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of serial killer but also into one of very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to date br br ve read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be landmark tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don want any more personally would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge him br br we ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of serial killer and yes do agree that the genre is bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied br br like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what it all about and not how it all about and guess that what some people don like true do like explanations with my movies but when movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in br br noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing wouldn be surprised if this film took home few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me it at least get nominated for best picture br br ve noticed that ve kind of been repeating myself not because there nothing else to say but because can stress enough how fantastic thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured good time guess this film was just little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did lot of good drugs if so want what he was smoking br br out of 4 &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and was totally prepared to have good time at least thought d be able to stand it but was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching america funniest home videos the damn parents hated them so much the stereo typical latino family need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends must say it so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once &#39;,
 &#39; war movie is hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichã dialogue rehashed plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat once in while however war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil war era cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renã zellweger is such film br br then again calling cold mountain war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with quite literally quick and dirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived br br cold mountain soon takes drastic turn though as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm ada cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of wilderbeast coming to ada rescue is the course tough as nails ruby thewes played by renã zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada br br within these two settings vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading anti war message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century it hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant br br director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot br br make no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama it is unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of people torn apart by war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether &#39;,
 &#39; ardh satya is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema directed by the great director govind nihalani this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be commercial success even today ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india br br the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s unlike any police of other cities in india mumbai police encompasses different system altogether govind nihalani creates very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment br br amongst various police officers colleagues the film describes the story of anand velankar young hot blooded cop coming from poor family his father is harsh police constable anand himself suffers from his father ideologies incidences of his father atrocities on his mother anand approach towards immediate action against crime is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction the film is here revolved in plot wherein anand constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction resulting from the frustrations his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms bars also turning him to an alcoholic br br the spirit within him is still alive as he constantly fights the system he is aware of the system of the metro where the police politicians are inertly associated by far end his compromise towards unethical practice is negative finally he gets suspended br br the direction is master piece thoroughly hard core one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty house to arrest him followed by short conversation which is fantastic at many scenes the film has hair raising moments br br the practical approach of script is major punch alcoholism corruption political influence courage deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today those aspects are dealt brilliantly br br finally the films belongs to the one man show om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly &#39;,
 &#39; my first exposure to the templarios not good one was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket &#39;,
 &#39; one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middle man titta di girolamo physically non descript middle aged man originally from salerno in southern italy when we re introduced to him at the start of the film he been living non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo cash tell him that 10 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you can bluff for while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo troubles br br this initially unsympathetic character scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of 50 man who won even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his non life titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamo days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out br br never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell amore or imbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist insomnia not unlike the machinist and in far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dell amore uses this condition to symbolise deeper emotional malaise that been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious it almost impossible to pin point its cause if indeed there is one br br the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani grand daughter of the legendary anna and the memory of titta best friend man whom he hasn seen in 20 years unexpectedly provide tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though it never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences film without single scene of sex or violence film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator expectations le conseguenze dell amore is fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittã xa0 during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino like fare more la vita ã bella style films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell amore imbalsamatore and others your loss world &#39;,
 &#39; watched this film not really expecting much got it in pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under fiver so what could expect and you know what was right they were all terrible this movie has few and few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is nice touch the drummer is very like drummer e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what can only assume was an attempt to build tension whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they don half mention how beautiful he is hell of lot thought he looked bit like meercat all this and haven even mentioned the killer m not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as m concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasn because of their acting talent ve certainly seen lot worse but ve also seen lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry &#39;,
 &#39; okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morse character helps out his ride who is in bit of pickle but what wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in series created by david koepp great writer is heaven br br due to the lack of love for this show by many can see it going to season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me let hope something good can make it past first series &#39;,
 &#39; it had all the clichã of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie felt like sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were movie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didn hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br this movie is not worthy of more words but will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br if you are looking for mindless entertainment still wouldn recommend this movie &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is based on the book many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites topic that comes from han personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time br br other than that the story is stereotypical romance with memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives wonderful oscar nominated performance as doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing romantic lead as journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined br br the cinematography really brings out fifty hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is real tear jerker some may consider sentimental romances passã but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is shining example &#39;,
 &#39; as disclaimer ve seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn in the musical however it tainted me when watched the musical br br actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical &#39;,
 &#39; preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her case br br there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston the henry luce clone thatcher memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane story this method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident br br this is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators they are garner right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henry br br typical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes tom confrontation with the union in major walk out and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henry wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the union headquarters killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black br br m not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane success few films do including all of orson welles other films but am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home br br when they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her br br similarly tom too gets full shock which makes him martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with son but it turns out to be eve son by tom son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself br br the film is not total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america &#39;,

 &#39; return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the western clint eastwood digitally remastered and new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old days br br this film is simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era br br act one sets up the premise workers in dye mill of small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters they can do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had minor success in getting liu to impersonate highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times br br act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mr miyagi style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way br br act three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks they sure don make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets repeat screening on monday so if you re game for nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for &#39;,

 &#39; just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about dozen years ago br br it not big movie and doesn try to make big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie br br the dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of valet putting on production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anyway br br this is character driven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only 47 years old is completely believable as very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they re taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as mother than as valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple br br yes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there aren other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge there is wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have been br br although it doesn get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplay br br had remembered this as being good movie but wasn prepared to be as completely mesmerized as was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then encourage you to see the dresser &#39;,
 &#39; really like salman kahn so was really disappointed when seen this movie it didn have much of plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali larter her acting had lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not lot to be desired and hope salman does lot better on his next movie thank you &#39;,
 &#39; it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with cast like shã kasugi christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect adventure of all time it actually is pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if it made in the 90s it doesn have modern feel it more has the same feeling that old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just can hate it think it an okay adventure movie and really love the soundtrack damn want the theme song &#39;,
 &#39; maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like buffoon but had expectations for entrails of virgin to be at least bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by weird japanese penetrator turns out it way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever there a problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least little tack and maybe just smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creature killer whatever entrails of virgin has neither it safe to say it a pretty soulless movie even if isn one of the very worst ever made it there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other heads br br in this case we re given photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by murderer as he credited first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decides he has to put in quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like it from another movie then once settled into the house there a wrestling scene that poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like amato creature is simply covered in mud and given stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one br br now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the croã tons are the best part of wretchedly tasting salad an eye gouging scene spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl whose inconsequential name can remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors you think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of virgin is that of lumpy one where it just there to be gawked at and without shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether &#39;,
 &#39; oh god must have seen this when was only 11 or twelve don ask how may have been young but wasn stupid anyone could see that this is bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly ve seen more impressive effects at disneyland ve seen better performances at school play and ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glass br br the story is set in northern australia handful of ambitious young people are trying out new water sport surfing in shark filled waters it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water after they learn what they get the help of grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family br br think have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is lake placid and the worse of which is its sequel blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick think with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind br br the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than hundred injuries or deaths every year movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such creature but good hour and half of the viewer life unless you really want to see it avoid blood surf &#39;,
 &#39; fate leads walter sparrow to come in possession of mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number 23 as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end br br the number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had good idea he just didn know how to develop it to stretch over ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful br br joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself little with phone booth and few other films but the number 23 reminds me that he still capable of making stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just can get good focus he moves the film at clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to what actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film that titled the number 23 is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished br br the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating 3 10 &#39;,
 &#39; we brought this film as joke for friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving substandard performance the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible &#39;,
 &#39; this was probably the worst movie have ever seen in my life it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous and have never seen such bad acting in my life the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller don know what these people were thinking when they made this movie didn even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch was very disappointed the whole movie was complete waste of time in my opinion &#39;,
 &#39; this is typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds wouldn call this spoiler because anyone who has read steele novel knows how they all end if you don want to know much about the plot don keep reading br br gilbert character ophelia is woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she otherwise good actress cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent brad johnson also an excellent actor is matt who is recovering from rather nasty divorce he is gentle convincing and compelling in this role br br the two meet on the beach through her daughter pip and initially ophelia accuses matt of being child molester just because he talked art with the kid all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love br br the chemistry between the two leads is not great even though the talent of these two people is not in my opinion question they did the best they could with predictable plot and script that borders on stereotypical two people meet tragedy bigger tragedy secret is revealed another tragedy and then they get together wish there was more to it than that but there it is in nutshell br br wanted mindless entertainment and got it with this in regard to the genre of romantic films this one fails to be memorable secret affair with janine turner is far superior not steele book as are some of steele earlier books turned into film &#39;,

 &#39; hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again take superheroes for example for each man and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors g the ring 2 the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudges br br the first grudge wasn entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge 2 is exactly like the previous this could be good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge 2 the critic goes the same way br br tired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichã all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dull br br the chills are all over there girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldn enter house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesn that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day it getting easier to hold grudge against hollywood bullshits &#39;,
 &#39; deanna durbin nan grey and barbara read are three smart girls in this universal film from 1936 which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences it also stars ray milland mischa auer charles winninger john king binnie barnes and alice brady it a sweet story about three young women now living in switzerland with their divorced mother who hear their father winninger is marrying again not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him they board ship to america with the help of the housekeeper nanny determined to stop the wedding realizing that the intended called precious barnes is nothing but gold digger aided and abetted by her mother brady they arrange for her to be introduced to wealthy count this is arranged by their father accountant king the man he chooses is full time drunk auer but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count milland what mess br br this is delightful film not cloying or overly sugary at all with some nice performances particularly by auer milland barnes and brady the young women are pretty and all do good work the emphasis of course is on young durbin who is natural actress and beautifully trained singer in fact her voice as youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult she has no trouble with the high notes as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice she sings delightful il bacio in police station br br one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father played by charles winninger not want his children around until he sees them and gets to know them barnes as the gold digger isn all that young but the girls mother looks way up there so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with younger more glamorous woman in fact he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters br br universal gives durbin the big star buildup here she has the final shot in the movie ray milland at this point was still paying his dues and it will probably be surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is br br very entertaining and of course this led to sequel and big stardom for deanna &#39;,
 &#39; well like to watch bad horror movies cause think it interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie always compare this movies to for example some spielberg works and again and again don understand the huge difference in what see like ed wood movies cause it so inept it very funny but people the chilling is not funny and is not even interesting it extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable there no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood it extremely inept amateurish film it definitely the worst movie had ever seen and had seen lot of worst movies believe me warned you 1 10 &#39;,

 &#39; have been mario fan for as long as can remember have very fond memories of playing super mario world as kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space br br the story begins much like any other mario game mario receives letter from princess peach inviting him to celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peach castle mario finds bowser and his son bowser jr attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma home floating space station here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure begins br br the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games br br my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives still these minor problems aside it a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that we ve been waiting for on the wii br br perfect 10 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; okay last night august 18th 2004 had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr van bebble at showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival here what have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie ve ever seen second of all in short a session after the show mr van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van bebble take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and m assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so had second dibs on questions asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting you shut the up this is the truth all those other movies are bullsh br br well anyway didn even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when read the tagline for the film you ve heard the laws side of the story now hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn want to have anything to do with how in god name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock roll mind of man who couldn even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the public image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual br br the film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers felt like was at midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presented br br all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write bunch of bullsh books or make bunch of bullsh movies etc etc case in point even the disclaimer based on true story is dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made difference in the world all you have to do is little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read book instead br br all can say is this when the film ended got free beer so m glad went but not so glad spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the up for asking the director question peace &#39;,

 &#39; the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that am never tired of seeing it over and over again however am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director attenborough credits that puzzles me aren they proud of making claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience am hoping would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film &#39;,
 &#39; while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find planet where they do meet god like alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes don have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the director chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in round by campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise should have given it three out of ten instead of five &#39;,

 &#39; revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn necessarily make lightning strike twice br br the halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi eyes from that previous film there was court battle with the white zombie film rights owners who didn want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victims br br wanna create mind controlled army of zombies be ready to crack few eggs including your own br br the lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over woman who isn worth spit br br this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments ve ever seen you have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isn even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is classic it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films m not sure whose favorite film this would be but they re obviously an idiot br br not recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was one of the best movies that have seen this year didn see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but think this is better put together movie it actually has point if you are going to see whole bunch of a you will be disappointed just well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need lot of humor you will find this to be really good movie definitely think that ebert and roeper review of this movie is right on mean don really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that will agree about the movie contains good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny &#39;,
 &#39; two hours ago was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes 2000 close ups predominated it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or serious of close ups not only tony leung deserves prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema &#39;,
 &#39; luckily for bill murray this is such light weight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story of low rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in two day olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making pretty memorable film debut br br the film is sprinkled with medium sized laughs chuckles and more than few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness br br the film takes serious note involving shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course it up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudy situation seems tacked on to great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad libbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn fit in but before it all over murray performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace br br the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesn matter this is pretty good film on many levels don let the absurd 5 6 rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey feldman 8 of 10 stars br br the hound &#39;,
 &#39; anyone who thinks kool moe dee carol alt and corey feldman comprise list of good actors must be smoking something d love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed up has been and never was love to star in actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain bad br br there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed do you think m an idiot yes carol do your agent does and please for the love of all that is decent and holy go away and stop degrading yourself like this this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in br br would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway so barely paid attention &#39;,
 &#39; this film could have been decent re make and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried assembling talented actors together with successful experienced writer director should be formula for decent film but ms english experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film br br am surprised that none of the reviews have read mention what found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into mini series or sit com think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms english talents didn translate cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that felt like came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesn recreate her stereo typed role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such great talent and yet such poor performance enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesn translate to the 2000s and no one helped ms english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance think it could have been good but it was not br br it so frustrating to go to movie that has good stars and good writer or director and come away feeling it was waste of everyone time money this new yorker cartoon saw yesterday is appropriate few movie execs are having meeting the caption reads let remake classic with worse everything &#39;,
 &#39; just watched this movie on it premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia liked not loved mork mindy as kid mostly for robin william zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this movie br br was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robin journey from struggling street jester to national v star and how such drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just cute impression although it was even dead on on an unrelated note noticed that robin struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was under appreciated by network v and held back creatively but that the taxi behind the scenes biopic br br all in all this was very enjoyable flick in which felt got to know little more of the man behind the orkan the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckles robin was hoot not great masterpiece by any means would have liked to have seen tad more about pam dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fans out there nanoo nanoo &#39;,
 &#39; before begin let me get something off my chest m huge fan of john eyres first film project shadowchaser the film b grade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of cinematic genius but is hugely entertaining action film that became cult hit spawned two sequels spin off br br judge and jury begins with joseph meeker convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called bloody shootout which seems like poor name for killing spree â meeker kills three people while trying to rob convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her â michael silvano washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his son coach but once executed meeker returns as revenant or as kelly perine calls hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making silvano life misery br br let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not true horror film it is supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache drag queen clown stand up comedian shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesn stop martin kove from shooting keith with desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meeker wife br br director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the film main flaw since there nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washed up cop quite well kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse &#39;,
 &#39; ye lou film purple butterfly pits secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her ex lover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after chance meeting br br agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes convoluted semi historical conflict for plot without giving the audience single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesn help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally don mind dark movies but the absence of light the bone jarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad film making techniques really make this tough film to watch and stay interested in also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but don think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and don believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments don add to its watchability br br the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator br br all in all very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he 2 10 &#39;,
 &#39; after hearing about george orwell prophetic masterpiece for all of my life m now 37 but never having read the book am totally confused as to what ve just seen br br am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as m sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been complete mystery and even with it m still no more educated about the story of 1984 than was before watched it br br on the plus side br br the cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was fantastically dark piece of film making br br now for the down sides and there are plenty br br there is war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanation br br who is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isn he on the front line why doesn he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink he drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why isn he brainwashed like the rest of them what the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that haven read the book without it this is just confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on br br the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it very annoying all the same br br also know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage br br personally can abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is few steps too far the other way can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you ve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that ve seen many people say would find it very hard to understand why 1984 is hailed as the classic it is br br there no denying that it was light years ahead of it time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been sort of bible to the powers that be but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline br br guess have to do what should have done from the start and buy copy of the book if m to make any sense out of this br br all in all very disappointed in something ve waited for years to watch &#39;,
 &#39; remember seeing this film in the theater in 1984 when was 6 years old you do the math absolutely loved it was tarzan for the 2 weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that saw highlander very shortly after this 1984 was the last time saw that film until about month ago it happened to be on cable as was getting ready for bed at 3 30 am and even though it was late and was tired and had to be at work at 9 00 am stayed up to watch this movie that loved as kid br br upon viewing it realized that it was not that great of film and even odder then that that andie macdowell voice was dubbed by someone else ian holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazing br br as stated earlier am lambert fan but m used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is shame that he never got chance to portray character with such depth again br br so to make short story way too long was little disappointed that the film was not that good but was glad to see that lambert was good and do not regret staying up until 6 00am to see it &#39;,
 &#39; from the film first shot keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through field at dawn thus invoking all the clichã cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama knew was in for something to make me want to kill myself br br joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms but sort of certificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular p is not about passion sexual tension or love it about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from matrix reloaded style dance orgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety br br the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances br br it was so obviously trying to be serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both austen methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you can lose jane austen technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography br br elizabeth bennett is supposed to be woman an adult mature and sensible and clear sighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is tragic heroine elizabeth wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with what lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austen elizabeth at least in austen eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightley elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfayden br br donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly but was played as complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in modern day romantic comedy br br just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache &#39;,
 &#39; the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clichã with great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like rehearsal then real movie but after all it a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was not so much promoted here in greece even though it got good actors great script and rather good photograph was not so called blockbuster movie in my country the movie itself is very powerful it about the hard time that newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from 5yo prison time drugs the end is rather sad mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well lambropoulou is great and very sexy in strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency 7 out of 10 because very few greek movies can make such an impression &#39;,
 &#39; mystery men has got to be the stupidest film ve ever seen but what film thought it was fabulous excellent and impressive it was funny well done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for change and being able to pull it off this was great ll definitely watch it again &#39;,
 &#39; you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink that a great metaphor for this movie kept watching even though it was really difficult but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with minty fresh feeling this movie left me with bad taste in my mouth should have spit it out when had the chance br br the premise is corny enough to be fun for the first time in like thousand years gargoyles have returned to romania and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead it up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok unfortunately the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles br br in the end this movie feels like poor man van helsing if you check your brain at the door this might get you through dreary monday night gave it 3 out of 10 stars &#39;,
 &#39; can believe it that was the worst movie have ever seen in my life laughed couple of times probably because of how stupid it was if someone paid me to see that movie again wouldn the plot was so horrible it made no sense and the acting was so bad that couldn even tell if they were trying that movie was terrible rating &#39;,
 &#39; even though m quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since can remember br br it the sort of film that is worth trying the once can see why it wasn released in the cinema but it is certainly great film to put on the tv was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didn much details except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars d never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actors br br the film had slow start but as it developed could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as huge fan sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennon accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the make up artists made them look excellent br br this paragraph may be counted as spoiler br br as mentioned before it got off to slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film found the bit in the park total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennon rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings tear to my eye whenever watch it br br it is quite different from the other biographical films ve seen where it about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well g backbeat br br in conclusion would say if you re beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about 95 minutes long it worth waiting for the film to develop br br if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the comments page for this film d be very interested &#39;,

 &#39; think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it been made and simply is it one and half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girls br br sure the main characters get their bloody piece in bad way which is basically fine since it a horror movie and usually like horror movies ve no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever it no spectacle other than that it simply grotesque it so lame it even gets boring and really quick too br br the worst thing if the above wasn bad enough for ya about this movie is that they ve tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap hand held cameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough there an explanation namely they are their with camera looking for the blair witch in this film there no other explanation than hey ya ll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many time you can make out what they re saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound wise or other wise br br than finally there the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock br br my advise don watch this under any circumstances &#39;,
 &#39; why can a movie be rated zero or even negative number some movies such as plan nine from outer space are so bad they re fun to watch this is not one the dungeon of horror might be the worst movie ve ever seen some of anyway had to fast forward through lot of it fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age there may be worse movies ve seen but thankfully can remember them the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint the special effects looked like fifth grader c diorama set in shoebox the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant he then immediately gets into scuffle with his escaping victim who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it without the gun having been reloaded this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated though guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes studio isn needed this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as the manipulator the worst movie have ever seen with an actual one time hollywood leading man mickey rooney the only time would recommend watching the dungeon of harrow or the manipulator for that matter would be if someone were to pay you m kind of cheap d have to have 7 or 8 bucks for dungeon and at least ten for manipulator phil the never out of the can cinematographer &#39;,
 &#39; this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that we re plunged into semi cheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities it a slow uphill set up kind of like the ride up slope of really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in it full blown old school horror steve johnson make up effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups the tongue in cheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on double bill with the 1999 remake of house on the haunted hill the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking &#39;,
 &#39; though d heard that cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade watched it giving it chance after all first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us 4 000 and though it looks even cheaper can begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as watched it realized why but whatever chances you re ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes it an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and they re made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two count em minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it not even funny bad br br we ve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong there gang rape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clark films though also moralist and sexploitative are high class masterworks compared to this crap br br don think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numb minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesn care bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but he a narcissistic control freak he anticipates the criticisms he bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is could relate to that br br despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us minimum of visual or narrative structure he can even decide if he wants gritty realism hand held video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he can even decide where to put his camera there use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the director profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of minimum of talent or technique to go with it br br it very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo blat can be highly effective under good direction as in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here he told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped actors in recent memory he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn br br the film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middle class youth stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he trying to preach in fiction but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they re middle class and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior couldn tell br br with its dogmatic self righteousness headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom cama de gato is bad for 1 000 reasons but above all it harmful in very insidious manner it gives detractors of brazilian cinema powerful case of argument cama de gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten &#39;,

 &#39; the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga br br that as poetical as ll get when talking about azumi 2 death or love because when cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying blood driven assassin after watching azumi 2 started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before br br not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but won hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menace br br this brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no one surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi 1 the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched br br the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides much needed resolution br br as fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation won lie and ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but ll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 the original was made to look like flawless masterpiece for what it worth azumi 2 death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying &#39;,
 &#39; haven read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health it isn that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie you can count the number of pages by anne rice that ve read on one hand but after seeing this movie and interview with vampire get the feeling that she writes really good novels the plots for both movies hint at whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history br br still stuart townsend voice over narration gets heck of lot more annoying than brad pitt vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that queen of the damned limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decided to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously one can see that the original novel had potential as movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack br br however ll give credit where credit is due the soundtrack is excellent korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead br br the film opens with very cool goth rock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly it as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects unfortunately queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress where are the yellow contacts where the pale blue make up scene after scene shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem lot and fright night when low budget was done right br br there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage props to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing did mention that the soundtrack was good let see what else can say it wasn too long the anne rice novel could have easily been three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything br br jy br br jimboduck dot com &#39;,
 &#39; leonard maltin gave this film dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide what film was he looking at kid vengeance or god gun are bombs this film is delight it is fantastic it is literate it is well mounted it is beautiful photographed making brilliant use of colors right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is well done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks 77 sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly edd byrnes george hilton and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work it is too bad mr maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved one can only guess as to his reason suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be kudos belong to everyone involved in this project this film is little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire &#39;,

 &#39; have just given 10 for thieves highway mention this for two reasons one to prove m not git who only gives bad reviews but 2 because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with woman of the night br br we all know pretty woman is chick flick but you can avoid them all they ll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as career more akin to that of dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is street walker prostitute we re talking about here has great life she healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling is this happy hooker type protagonist is lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make movie about type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if make film about chef but don want him to cook or talk about food or wear white hat then why make film about chef in the first place by bailing out and turning the hooker into respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what cop out really really lame br br secondly pretty woman insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep don leave home without it especially if you are moron in suit who has no imagination 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her it the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money where the charm where the charisma don mention that attempt at the piano please br br girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than calculator as they probably don either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate thieves highway wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject br br ll finish on song br br pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind like to treat pretty woman don believe you you re not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy br br pretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman couldn help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me br br pretty woman shop while pretty woman talk while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say you ll stay with me and ll pay you ll treat you right &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was terrible the plot was terrible and unbelievable cannot recommend this movie where did this movie come from this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including gary sinise kathy bates joey lauren adams and jennifer tilly &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is without doubt perfect 10 10 for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action think you people are rating it bad because there no plot because you think thats how smart movie critic would rate good movie but the way see it is good movie is movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie if you want true man true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan hes pure in everyway he literally makes american movies look like walk in the park and even in todays movies american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do masterpiece &#39;,
 &#39; can believe this movie managed to get such relatively high rating of 6 it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring certainly one of the worst films have seen in long long time br br in no budget way it reminded me of star wars episodes and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching total creative train wreck br br this film should be avoided at all costs it one of those festival films that only please the pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it different therefore good br br bad film making is not different it just bad film making &#39;,
 &#39; this movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber br br this guy john ben chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of bank teller in small provincial english town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for nadia nicole kidman ordered by email from russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by johns plan however glitch turns up nadia does not speak word of johns language although calm and emotionless on the outside john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her dictionary to start the communication process br br what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of decently paid safe feeling clerk into decision making decently thinking action figure giving the viewer subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise br br kidman cassel kassovitz make great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background br br the pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you re in the middle of the plot and are left with desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out br br my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy to sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of wheel in society machine the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings welcome to the machine bet that in the end john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all br br thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie please make sequel and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 9999 percent of the potential viewers am sure of it &#39;,
 &#39; think this movie has got it all it has really cool music that can never get out of my head it has cool looking characters is really funny you know the kind that you ll crack up on the ground and you ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks despite the bad acting bad cgi and bad story about cops going after robot its really cool its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch get together eat pizza laugh like crazy and watch it two more times br br there are so many funny parts like when kurt was trying to get edison attention and gave him the finger and then threw paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball on that part kept saying remember remember to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened there was also really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought and kurt was talking about his strange dream and how he was superman loved that part although it has been while since saw it so don remember that part everything the actors said were funny like how kurt says worship you like god to the robot br br although there was some bad things in all it was great movie man can stop laughing wish had that movie &#39;,
 &#39; howard kevin kline teaches english at the high school in small indiana city he is finally getting married to emily joan cusack much to his parents delight the town is abuzz too because one of its own cameron matt dillon has been nominated for an acting oscar everyone including howard and emily is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner in his acceptance speech cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as gay military man in part because of lessons he learned from gay teacher he had in high school you guessed it its howard but howard has never come out in fact he believes he is straight with the whole town and members of the media waiting and observing the happenings will howard and emily go ahead and get married or is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony this is wonderful funny and humane film about gay man and his situation as the man who did not realize he was gay kline is excellent and touching the rest of the cast is equally fine with cusack stitch as the mixed up fiancã and dillon bob newhart debbie reynolds tom selleck and others on hand to delight the audience as well the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful then too the script the direction and the production are very very nice but the insightful humorous and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film best asset no doubt for those who would be offended by gay themed film yes just skip over this one but for everyone who wants to laugh heartily and gain better understanding of the gay situation at the same time this is definitely the best film out there &#39;,
 &#39; nice character development in pretty cool milieu being male m probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isn as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what enjoyed about this movie is that it didn go for cheap comedy when it could have it didn try to pound lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light did have little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people &#39;,

 &#39; saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it then again that was when claire danes was good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywood ized bitch she is today anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films how far would you really go for your best friend was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when watch it now own it remember as soon as left the theater called my best friend and sobbed to her how much loved her this is great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you do something like that for her &#39;,

 &#39; yes ll say before start commenting this movie is incredibly underrated br br sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of sports star glass is drawn into seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind br br the acting was good apart from thewlis br br stone really has talent with this role she slick naughty and seductive and doesn look day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino morrisey was also good he showed much vunerablitity in role that needed it thewlis however was lame he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way he really sucked br br overall this movie not as good the first but stone is hoot to watch just ignore thewlis &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was so bad it was funny for awhile there thought was actually watching parody of bad movie la for your consideration the cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt the script was dreadful enough but coupled with sean young terrible acting especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail complete with flashbacks while dangling off cliff makes it truly classically bad movie worth watching in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie still can believe how this thing got made first of all how did such bad script get the green light how did star actors get attached were they at low points in their careers questions questions &#39;,
 &#39; supposedly social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970 nightmare is full of bad southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just thinly disguised babe in prison movie especially in its uncut original version nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors in particular does good job of making viewers hate him even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes there also change of pace role for the late robert reed who appears as the lecherous warden and tina louise previously ginger of gilligan island made rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade br br &#39;,
 &#39; resnais wow the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voice over with old embellished inter titles was nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for tea party this is all in the first 60 seconds br br then the music starts rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes speak french so can blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film br br m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out endured br br it didn get much better ll tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we don even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot it as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into 2 hour movie with bad songs br br the only thing that kept me watching as long as did 1 hour was that was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours not me maybe tomorrow ll try watching the end aw who am kidding have more important things to do m sure you do too skip this &#39;,
 &#39; saw this movie in the middle of the night when was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch it one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it good and so bad it well just plain bad it worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it both great middle of the night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag don even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply &#39;,
 &#39; paul verhoeven predecessor to his breakout hit basic instinct is stylish and shocking neo noir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve played by jeroen krabbã gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine halsslag renã soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills him br br paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on paul verhoeven is not filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things like best about him this film features very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesn happen very often wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work but you ll see what mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one ve mentioned but are lovely nonetheless man gets eaten by lions another one has pipe sent through his skull boat is smashed in half lovely br br the acting in the fourth man isn anything to write home about but it solid throughout jeroen krabbã holds the audience attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is renã soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoeven direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and it a shame that he doesn put it to better use of all the verhoeven films ve seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me it worth the effort &#39;,
 &#39; there is difference between film and movie film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption movie is what group of friends gets together to make over the course of weekend with camcorder in my time as viewer have seen may examples of both br br on september 19 attended screening of writer director jon satejowski donnybrook now having read the script and having seen two different cuts rough cut and the finished product of this piece can safely say it is movie and student movie at that it is for lack of better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on camera and capture moving images the visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish relationship with the characters understand that this is modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone long way toward keeping the audience interested br br granted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog steven soderbergh sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind this movie however has neither the main story is weak and unfocused if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then feel this movie misses the point what got out of it is that davie main aspiration is to change the face of rock roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming guitar we are simply told that davie has played lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show don tell the audience anyone who has taken creative writing class knows this also davie doesn look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970 he looks like he be more comfortable in the early days of rock roll posing as james dean less talented brother in the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clichã characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency e the subplot involving terry father if want to see film with this kind of haphazard construction will consider watching napolean dynamite again film could barely make it through the first time br br as for the above mentioned dialog scenes guess should mention that they are few and extremely far between is it too much to ask for characters who do speak don think it is when the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly over the top outbursts these characters simply do not behave like normal rational people working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film al hudson and that just because he doing poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesn see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it ll hurt his creative vision being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in constructive manner is the mark of self indulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider br br in the end we are left with poor high school set knock off of zach braff amazing garden state combined with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two films far more worthy of your time br br now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best can do is compliment mr satejowski for having the ambition to make film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur this is student movie nothing more nothing less if the movie holds any promise and let face it at this point it isn going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this if if the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt don attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you if you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called film br br am your audience and am willing to watch &#39;,
 &#39; please re watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch badly thought out 25min tv episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life truly an awful film tubbs and edward are in it for few mins micky has 1 line and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns also mr briss accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras and really few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap batman and robin all is forgiven &#39;,
 &#39; tainted look at kibbutz life br br this film is less cultural story about boy life in kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and it all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is gross caricature of wellâ evil br br the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every character situation represents different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is strikingly handsome european looking 12 year old boy â his older brother is typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn seen in long time due to his military service he orders quote â linda go take shower and cum in two minutes br br there is one other good character in this movie â european foreigner who plays the mother boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy mom when her mental health takes turn for the worse br br the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently can escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose it a mystery how the boy father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br that the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience head â that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn fit in feel sorry for the guy who made this film â obviously he had bad experience growing up in kibbutz but feel as though he took few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs &#39;,
 &#39; fulci does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made answer yes cat in the brain also known as nightmare concert is fulci last masterpiece yes it is no matter what some people will say about it there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci movies br br fulci make fun of himself and his movies with this one lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself who plays well horror splatter gore director who thinks he is slowly going insane it filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here being fulci flick you need to know it gory how much well pretty much always loved gore in the movies and never get enough of it but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore and believe me it a hard to archive even the braindead didn stop it citb is all about gore almost every scene revolves about fulci who after being hypnotized by khmmm evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor which starts to spit some ooze from it wounds forget the beyond or zombie 2 this is the goriest fulci movie now like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie he is such brilliant director some funny moments and lines happens from time to time like one where fulci says making gore movies is kind of sickness ending is very good considering that fulci and most of the italian horror masters is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes if you are fun of the fulci make sure you check it out if you have weak stomach avoid this and repeat its only movie ps some of the gore scenes within this movie chainsaw dismemberment full tongue torn out eyeballs torn out maggot infested corpses zombies decapitations face being putted in boiling water stabs in the shower to head throat slit many parts of the body and organs being toast aside hammer smashed face &#39;,
 &#39; love to watch this movie lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana br br really love to watch lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem little fake but it okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and think it got good ending even though didn really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings figured it out over time and that the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you re watching it the first time br br this is best movie &#39;,
 &#39; some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from pou soi cheang isn really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison however it still packs punch that makes it worth watch particularly if gritty hard edged action is your thing br br edison chen plays pang cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of judge sam lee is wai the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost with wai closing in on his target pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeâ until he meets yue pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse br br relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography amazing sound design haunting score and solid performances from chen and lee as well as newcomer pei pei as pang love interest dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence think along the lines of chan wook park vengeance trilogy stabbings shootings merciless beatings all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang br br of course this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved and sure enough pretty much everyone in this film dies rather nasty deaths unfortunately there is fine line between tragedy and unintentional comedy and in its final moments dog bite dog crosses it in laughably over dramatic final scene pang and wai are locked in battle as pregnant yue looks on eventually after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas wounded pang performs diy ceasarean on now dead yue delivering their baby moments before he himself dies br br whilst this film might not be classic slice of hong kong excess with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals it still worth seeking out &#39;,
 &#39; watched this movie for the hot guy and even he sucked he was the worst one well okay have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too he was even worse the guy wasn that cute in the end he had the most terrible accent and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can stand up to his mom for the one he loves there ever been overall and if this makes any sense to you when go to pick up movies at the video store think to myself as read the back of movie that looks so so well at least it can be worse than carolina moon the most terrible movie and the most terrible writing acting plot everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips it was the most horrid movie will ever see with gabriela way up there too hated it and trust me if there was any number under 1 imdb had for rating d choose that in heartbeat &#39;,
 &#39; have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say even though this movie did not get the best comments this movie made my day it got me thinking what false world this is br br what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you it said that no matter how often you feed milk to snake it can never be loyal and will bite when given chance same way some people are such that they are never grateful this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself br br brother dies inadvertently at the hands of gangster the surviving brother decides to take revenge through this process we learn about the futility of this world nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone br br amitabh gave the performance of his life the new actor aryan gave good performance the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given chance to fully express herself br br great movie by raj kumar santoshi his movies always give some message to the audience his movies are like novels of nanak singh punjabi novelist who novels always had purpose and targeted social evil because they have real message for the audience they are entertaining as well as lesson giving &#39;,
 &#39; focus is another great movie starring william macy first discovered macy in fargo and ve seen few of his films and he hasn yet deceived me macy is the archetypal nice guy with something to hide in focus he plays the role of lawrence newman loyal and hard working stiff who harbours his handicapped mother at home the scene is set after world war ii at the height of mccarthyism newman is the head of human resources for company which is basically anti semite after he accidentally hires woman of jewish descent he is asked to buy pair of glasses to improve his failing eyesight br br unbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart his wife played by great laura dern as the film unravels newman will begin to see whole different world where being jewish is akin to being an animal br br the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal the chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is &#39;,
 &#39; in brave new girl holly comes from small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at local competition and gets admitted to prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into colorful story of friendship and loyalty loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and was very pleased with the end it seems sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite gem in the film archives &#39;,
 &#39; was looking forward to the guardian but when walked into the theater wasn really in the mood for it at that particular time it kind of like the olive garden like it but have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it br br m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect m still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian features br br it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of tense rescue mission and was gripped tighter than kenny rogers orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin smirk that make george clooney proud yeah we get it was totally ready to hate him br br but then he had to go and deliver fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs br br darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily film that dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clichã predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment value br br had bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group br br do you have what it takes to be rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isn bad enough sometimes you can save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies br br man who wants all that responsibility not me had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education br br not only does the guardian do great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does good job of entertaining its paying customers br br the gist br br moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it like to embark on daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian chance saw it for free but had paid would ve felt had gotten my money worth &#39;,
 &#39; going into see seven pounds wasn clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot have no idea what is going on and you think tim who claims to be ben is just big asshole all of this comes to an end when the twist so to speak is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith was troubled and haunted by big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to br br the acting of this film is great as feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress rosario dawson to me this is one of her better movies aside from eagle eye which think is up there to she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film other actors such as woody harrelson have very small roles and not big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film was still good br br this movie was definitely not what expected and certainly lot slower pace in which hoped the movie however was still pretty good nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place up until then it just seems like pointless love story final thought seven pounds seven stars &#39;,
 &#39; it a unique film as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory because he seems so reserved detached he perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter of factly uses all those around him however in the deadly serious no pun intended last act when coward must make like the flying dutchman he much less comfortable br br but his way with an epigram is peerless and hecht macarthur have given him some gems macarthur really he was the wit of the pair br br the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes but has little camera movement aside from storm sequence hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing getting their dialogue on screen note m themselves have blink and you ll miss em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene br br the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward br br curious that woolcott would agree to do film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table of which he was founder and macarthur something of an auxiliary member br br the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story though that victory is probably due more to coward imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot it coward woolcott and the dialogue you remember &#39;,
 &#39; this is definitely must see film the excellent director alain chabat also acting as ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of astã rix the french comic books it based upon and to create fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that non french audience or at least non french speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however it still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze gã rard darmon and edouard baer and please don ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books astã rix et obã lix contre cã sar and directed by claude zidi &#39;,
 &#39; consider myself bit of connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever made that is the robert wise paul newman flick somebody up there likes me that movie might be number 1 but gentleman jim is close number 2 br br the movie doesn just chronicle the rise of james corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at crucial time of transition in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare knuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved marquis of queensbury rules and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards time of acceptance and respectability br br gentleman jim is not realistic look at those days it is romanticized and yes even bit hokey at times but always delightfully so errol flynn is perfect as the gentleman jim who really isn a gentleman at all but merely fast talker from working class family alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has love hate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the end br br at the end of gentleman jim the great john sullivan whose famous line was not can lick any man in the world of course romanticism again hands over his belt to corbett this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch raging bull instead that is much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim is lot more fun &#39;,
 &#39; this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is recommendation then you haven seen any of the others there are the usual ingredients it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet shirt contests quite frequently the story is just laughably idiotic and the film takes itself much too seriously and then orang utans in africa br br but it has few things going for it bo looks great the production values sets costumes etc are quite good and this greatly enhances its camp value in strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly &#39;,
 &#39; note to self never ever ever again watch serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie makes navy seals look like reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies have ever seen this is great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there are possibilities for very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is stupid there no getting around it but so is dumb and dumber mind you dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this however for one love seeing stupid movies tail sting and laughing with group of good friends over how bad it is call me callous but see this movie and you ll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it &#39;,
 &#39; was looking forward to this so much being big fan of the book however when it came out remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time ve ever spent at the cinema br br in principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why m rating this 4 br br in this version sara is little too self sacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar br br there also far too much of disneyfied ending for me sara father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesn leave you thinking oh puh leeze br br about the only things true to the book were br br 1 sara father being soldier 2 the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heart no know you by heart you are inside my heart 3 sara friendship with becky and her adopting lottie although this last one wasn developed as much as it could have been 4 the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done 5 the basic core rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly is there but that about all that is br br people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all can say to that is have two cousins aged 7 and 12 respectively who were big fans of this film until they read the book br br if all you want is feel good family film then this delivers if you re looking for film that actually tells the story of little princess in fact if you ve read the book don waste time with this one it such shame with cast like this if they stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic br br am harping on about read the book this and read the book that little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt book especially such classic into movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once &#39;,
 &#39; have watched this movie countless times and never failed to be charmed by it homely simplicity sincerity and goodness great characterizations by all of the cast and the lovely little steam trains that play such an important supporting role confess fell in love with roberta in 1970 and she still touches me today shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day the nicest present could have had &#39;,
 &#39; if only had read the review by alex sander sic on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from select choice of the ignorant viewing public would not have seen this desecration alien was fantastic dramatic and well made horror sci fi predator was great sci fi action mess about do really have only myself to blame though as saw alien versus predator it too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site br br stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you br br right from the beginning this film was ridiculous no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun not overrun by aliens ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why from then on it gets really ridiculous always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out couldn here br br father and son are hunting in the woods the damaged ship crash lands to from the view given would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet br br an edgy thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless dull now cop friend from the bus when say introduced mean feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out slasher horror element is then introduced with sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty jock type american sportsman not scottish man oh the cute not cute boy is the ex con brother by the way yes they re clever these director brothers whose name will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again then modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc ripley credential type character introduction comes with female soldier returning home to her husband and child br br guess what happens next won tell you much more about the actual smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien ridden universe br br the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post read too late the aliens are boring the predator alien is ridiculous the action is at times exploitative gratuitous disgusting nonsense the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers oh was shocked alright shocked at how low some people will go to get what scare some shock to titillate the perverse what if you really wanted to shock titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them the characters have no depth and neither does the plot it filmed and paced badly it acted by disinterested people not that can blame them it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it really have to worry about you if you haven seen it then well please make your own decision br br ps did even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout &#39;,
 &#39; even though saw this film when was very young already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison br br apart from the liberty taken right at the end the film more or less faithfully follows the true story the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that br br of the performances there is scarcely poor performance and tommy steele is ideally cast also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan badel is good as always br br because the film sticks to the facts it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family &#39;,
 &#39; how do you take cast of experienced well known actors and put together such stupid movie nimrod antel has the answer armored six co workers at an armored car business decide to steal large shipment of cash themselves but just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly with plot like this you think it couldn be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys they joke they laugh have few drinks together etc then we suddenly learn they re planning to rob their own business the hero ty columbus short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though he a decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into money crazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scenes mike matt dillon goes on suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty it utterly unbelievable and movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot would say don waste your time too bad no one gave laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture &#39;,
 &#39; did not expect much from this film but boy boy did not expect the movie to be this bad chris rock is not showing good act here you can get the feeling that his caracter is real think the movie would have been bit better if it drama or romantic scenes would have been less part of the movie and more better humor was involved the movie is like the film makers were having bad hangover making it in the making of they don show single smile this is very bad film gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me but did never laugh &#39;,
 &#39; flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes different tack with this film and it works beautifully playing real life boxing champ jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from stifled san francisco bank teller to celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and dog including prominent judge the next day he gets chance via smith to gain entrance to the judge private club he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land spot as the club resident boxer his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion john sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is good match for flynn at this stage he needed female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by young and ebullient carson frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smith gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well it a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but it also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable believe you like me more than like you but it entirely possible that love you more than you love me it classic romantic dialogue and there are more than few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well &#39;,
 &#39; despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinkers d probably watch just about anything with them in the film as am huge fan of hollywood golden age of the 1930s and 40s however no matter how much love their films just can recommend this film br br the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two haven yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but stuck it out especially when fonda fell into snow bank and this stopped the yodeling in hindsight perhaps should have just turned it off then fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is also doctor and has him rayed and nurses him back to health he in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like sweet but very slight romantic comedy br br once home however all isn rosy as she jumps right back into her job as family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film plays it all for laughs but frankly fonda behaviors were really creepy spying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening any man she treats tripping patient who already has back injury and stomping into surprise party and insisting that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife he comes off as combination of sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but it all supposed to be for laughs considering that he seems like dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with restraining order but oddly she gets mad but just can stay mad at fonda because he so can think of the right word creepy is all that comes to mind later out of the blue multi millionaire fonda gets job working the counter at department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all thing of the past so job apparently cures anger and suspicions when this job falls through the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital giving barbara job there and they live happily ever after they don go any further with the story but assume based on fonda character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients br br the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together nor did the final horatio alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world they were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films &#39;,
 &#39; bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line it is about girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered position on local team there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives would recommend it for anyone who likes nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve the song choices are really good hush my child just move on up to your destination and you make boundaries and complications anyway hope that was at help to your needs in review bend it like beckham great flick &#39;,
 &#39; perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger where the sidewalks ends from really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel night cry by frank rosenberg br br dana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks andrews have as much right on the sidewalk as you br br dana andrew obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta br br by twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of laura are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail br br using his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way compromise br br the film is one of the best detective films of the 50 with curious moral values also one of preminger best br br preminger uses powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism &#39;,
 &#39; in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover son by that time was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with dead lover marriage of convenience and nutty ex lover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her ex lover confined against his will in psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to snow ball chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus &#39;,
 &#39; incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path know there are several versions of this and this is based on the 102 min one that watched but can fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck br br d heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sex nudity which honestly there isn much of here at all and boring when there is and blood but beware it the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like junior film school flunk project camera work is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like huge theater stage complete with grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much it tragic br br story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and fellini like turkey that only good for few gobble laughs and peter toole who makes most memorable tiberius oh yes which brings us to the big name actors d like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be part of this there ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time period br br 1 out of 10 from ozjeppe &#39;,
 &#39; did anyone edit this film or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes it ok though fell asleep watching it the first time then fell asleep the second time and the third time the plot is actually not the worst ve seen but it close the acting is not the worst ve seen either but it close the production well can honestly say that it was the worst had ever seen in my life not trying to be spiteful but unhinged could have used some more production br br please don think m hater of horror films or even that didn enjoy this film just felt was laughing at the film much more than felt was laughing along with it the gruesome moments were not too poorly done but could have been done better even with shoestring budget br br characters seemed awkwardly developed or ignored all together twist ending was pretty bad and the exposition took forever without exposing much br br d recommend avoiding this movie br br 1 10 &#39;,
 &#39; man with the screaming brain certainly isn a perfect movie but m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than star vehicle for bruce campbell meaning it works as kind of summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings campbell is as writer uneven there are lots of things in the story that don make great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because female brain has been implanted into it and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant where yegor and william battle for control of william body is straight out of evil dead ii there are however lots of little touches and non sequiturs that feel rather brilliant such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at statue what are you looking at the movie looks like sci fi channel original probably because it was the acting is actually pretty good particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored ted raimi handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce is funny as the arrogant sardonic condescending american jerk now that he writing his own films you think he give himself role that he hasn been typecast in already man with the screaming brain is bizarre nonsensical movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking cinematic experience too seriously &#39;,
 &#39; this film held my interest enough to watch it several times the plot has holes but the lead performers make it work br br catherine mary stewart julia kerbridge does great job as woman of 37 who has sacrificed everything else to become physician she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream br br meanwhile julia sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayo stewart to avoid having her become ward of the state amanda is about 7 years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her parent murder that she has become mute needless to say julia 16 hour days get longer caring for amanda br br rob lowe plays kevin finney charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with trick or joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia br br the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well arlen managed to convey quite lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out relationship as the film progresses br br we discover that julia sister and brother in law the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed br br in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by 2 of their former associates the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip location br br eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys the predictable ending has the three forming family and moving happily into future together br br what struck me about the plot were major holes kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity the killer that pretends to be psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention br br the film could have been lot better if the script had been refined more before filming filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort &#39;,
 &#39; like the previous poster am from northern vermont and was inclined to like this film however not since red zone cuba have seen such confusing plot the things the people to bootleg make no sense two of the gang paddle across the border send second party across in car uhm why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guy hideout in luxury packard wouldn just two people in flatbed truck make more sense then parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch the four fall asleep when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out of course they re spotted and shot at losing some of their precious cargo in the process then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in boat and float it over the border again why am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area all one needed was to drive vehicle that could outrun than the s canada border patrol which back then had fraction of the resources it has now br br and don get me started on the last half hour which made no sense whatsoever br br the only good thing can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years &#39;,
 &#39; may contain spoilers this movie was the worst movie ever couldn even watch it all it was so bad this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying whole lot this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times not even the gore in the film was good the shootings were fake and the acting was worse please do yourself favor and skip this one if you see it at the rental store then run the other way there is nothing good about this film at all if you want to see good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow rate this movie 0 2 out of 10 that how horrible this film really is the worst movie ever &#39;,
 &#39; recap something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block is dug out and brought to research station on antarctica julian rome former seti worker is brought in to decipher the message problem is that one of the researchers is old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica br br comments the movie holds few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds lot of surprises of its own and this time not in good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can be br br the movie is little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good br br 3 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this flick is so bad its beyond belief even for an independent low budget film it just well sucks can even believe even troma would put out such crap have been fan of some troma flicks for years toxic avenger squeeze play rockabilly vampire to name few but lloyd come on this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste it features some of the worst acting imaginable think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good oh wait that is what they did mean it these characters have negative charisma with any luck the producer and director of this film will have huge karmic debt because of this atrocity as will the special effects people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska and there are severe continuity problems the worst part however is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making but don take my word for it go out and waste four bucks renting it just don say didn warn you &#39;,
 &#39; this is very memorable spaghetti western it has great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from rosalba neri her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when she not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that there anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too br br the music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are couple of parts that are very amusing especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot there also lots of slick gun play that very well done br br would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn for two things the first being silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights have ever seen in movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like dance number from bad musical than any kind of real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were terence hill bud spencer comedy but this is more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma cowardly mexican sidekick guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in movie like this and he wasn at all funny all can say is where is tuco when you need him br br all that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is classic spaghetti western despite the faults have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie &#39;,
 &#39; the plot michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance he discovers molly in play and at once knows she will be big film star he signs her to contract with the stipulation that he must direct the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way what follows is recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy and oh yes there romance and little sadness too the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch the music is real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008 it must be emphasized that this movie is story 1st not just tribute to silent films later years would bring similar films such as singin in the rain 1952 dick van dyke carl reiner the comic 1969 what is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in 1939 we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era although some sound effects are included in glorious w while the rest of the movie is in pristine color one of the greatest in the silent era buster keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well but the real reason to watch the movie if your motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett film legacy it doesn take genius to realize this movie is positive reworking of mack sennett and mabel normand life the character michael linnett connors is mack sennett whose real name was michael sinnott and molly of course is mabel sennett had the pie throwings the bathing beauties and keystone cops he worked with buster keaton ben turpin cameo roscoe fatty arbuckle body double and fell in love with his leading lady not only all that but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well as most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture as mack sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies his career started in 1908 as an actor then writer director producer he semi retired in 1935 with about 500 films to his credit he had worked with the best such as charlie chaplin gloria swanson bing crosby c fields keaton harry langdon arbuckle and even roy rogers in way up thar as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career mack played it wise did only selective work for the next 25 years in 1931 he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in 1937 for lifetime of work in the 1940 his presence was still felt g here come the co eds 1945 where recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack wandering willies 1926 is done in 1947 the road to hollywood used some of sennett crosby films 2 years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated with his knack of always associating with the right people guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk his radio show came about later in the year 1950 brought re release of his greatest triumph tillie punctured romance 1914 with sound in 1952 he was honored on tv this is your life then his autobiography the king of comedy 1954 which is great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade was published 1955 brought more concrete association with abbott costello as he had cameo in c meet the keystone kops finally in 1957 another tribute with the compilation film the golden age of comedy so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of motion picture pioneer in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at long table as we get to the silver haired mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here am when he rises to give speech short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget mack sennett the individual maybe this movie will help &#39;,
 &#39; years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what terrible film it so bad and on so many levels that really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as whole it just doesn work at all to point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director cut or in this case let salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don know what going on or why we re watching what going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone death instead we watch thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings there no catalyst in this story br br one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows group of children who sing in the middle of forest edwards channeling sound of music it no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julie mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing striptease in the act the ending bird eye view of julie running towards hudson plane is another wink at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie plays singer born from german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence m like what happened here br br the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudson squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant what also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that one slow moving train there br br the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason gave this film 3 stars but it effect is diminished considerably because it repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no man land is ok even if it bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to group of injured soldiers at french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying br br the whole project is listless and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like she on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing traitor was good career decision as much as like julie she no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays german spy she still comes across as cloying and cute br br how bad is darling lili even after 37 years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release &#39;,
 &#39; it nice to see romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is little long and little clichã you cant help but like it br br think the story was little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as 100 days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friend br br it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good &#39;,
 &#39; owen loves his mamma only he love her better six feet under in this dark laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role br br throw momma from the train is terrific comedy even if it isn a great film it too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on but it a gut splitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being struggling writer devito is avid but untalented crystal is blocked and bitter br br crystal professor donner believes his ex wife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and can write more than the opening line of his next book which doesn come easy he teaches creative writing class of budding mediocrities including middle aged woman who writes tom clancy type fiction but doesn know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen an ascot wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus 100 girls d like to pork br br then there devito owen lift who calls himself professor donner star pupil even though the teacher won read his work in class owen is somewhat unusual character to star in movie man child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne ramsey who calls him lardass and other endearing sentiments in any other movie we be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train piles life cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along that one big reason why this film probably loses lot of people br br for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as lark it not as big stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner help in plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill donner hated ex then tells the professor it his turn to kill mrs lift swapping murders as seen in hitchcock strangers on train br br as director devito not only complements his actors performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriously br br also helping matters is writer stu silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here she not woman she the terminator one little murder and m jack the ripper those are all crystal words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are devito and ramsey apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and that a shame because he had real talent for it br br the best scene in this movie when crystal meets ramsey was actually used in its entirety as theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time ve seen movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as cousin patty and when momma says he doesn have cousin patty panicky owen loses it you lied to me he yells out slamming the professor forehead with pan br br of course in reality the professor wouldn groan out something witty from the floor but throw momma from the train works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth devito hasn disappeared from films of course but it a mystery why he hasn really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe it because as throw momma from the train lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isn to everyone tastes that too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it &#39;,

 &#39; it doesn happen very often but occasionally one man can make difference big difference br br george crile 2003 best seller charlie wilson war is fascinating and eye opening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas good time charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation likable and licentious even for politician charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone it easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as charlie angels br br when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is classic you can teach em to type but you can teach em to grow tits no argument there br br but even the most rakish rapscallion has conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the cold war as result fat chance huh br br under the skillful direction of mike nichols and smart snappy screenplay by adam sorkin charlie wilson war is sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind the scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising charlie team br br the on screen team is composed of three marvelous actors with four 4 academy awards and nine 9 nominations between them charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years he aided abetted and abedded by joanne herring wealthy houston socialite played by the still slinky julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all accounts ms roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even hint why kabul and country is so important to her character maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know but we as an audience never do as for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos smart street wise e non ivy league graduate cia malcontent who knows the score both in the agency boardroom and in wilson bedroom br br for the mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the s can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi 21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies this takes money lots of money and eventually charlie team covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of 1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels this includes top of the line state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices nasty nasty stuff br br that this kind of multi billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government oh momma wish it weren so br br even though the initial outcome for team charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention yes once the russkies left so did our aid zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people as result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster it like the forerunner to mission accomplished br br as nichol film so pointedly points out the ball you ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you ve lost interest in it mike krzyzewski knows this eva longoria parker knows this little lateesha in lafayette knows this but the typical american politician doesn so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn let the world know we were the good guys talk about catch 22 another mike nichols film br br perhaps charlie wilson said it best we ked up the end game br br again &#39;,
 &#39; this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970 hippie mentality in nut shell and bores us in the process its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups naive young hippy played by the waif like kay lenz hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him if you think that is superficial the whole film encapsulates such scenes she keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick couldn help but laugh throughout the film its obvious she just using him as meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit corny offering of music from the 70 is also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade &#39;,

 &#39; chuck jones rabbit seasoning the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three while find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons would have to concede that rabbit seasoning is the most finely honed script here the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello who on next routine as long term daffy fan have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines the famous pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer as always is the befuddled dupe part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration you re despicable as intricate an example of chuck jones impeccable timing as you ll come across rabbit seasoning is true classic &#39;,
 &#39; crossfire is justifiably famous 1947 noir that a murder mystery with strong message it stars robert young robert mitchum robert ryan sam levene and gloria grahame and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning and for the rest of the film young as the detective finlay in charge of the case seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death and just as important why the victim joseph samuels sam levene is someone the soldiers meet in bar they go up to his apartment to continue their visit and samuels winds up dead br br don know about 1947 but seeing crossfire today one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects don suppose it was so apparent back then as these actors were just getting started nevertheless the film packs big punch with its powerful acting good direction violence and unsparing anti semite language br br the characterizations are vivid including that of gloria grahame in smallish role she a woman who meets mitchell george cooper one of the suspect soldiers in bar and can provide him with an alibi the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan but everyone is excellent robert young especially is effective as tough but intelligent police detective mitchum is very likable as soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife br br truly excellent and must see &#39;,

 &#39; goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history their is no doubt about that but this game although quite different could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ of its time br br this was not bond game based on material from another medium this was completely new scripted game which even had its own theme song wouldnt be bond without it haha gameplay was excellent and if you re fan of the bond games or films alike you ll enjoy it br br unlike some most games these cast members portrayed their characters themselves as opposed to fictional creations for the game which gives it that more cinematic feel with very bond able storyline you feel like you re in the game as much as you get lost in movie br br enjoyable in all aspects from start to finish even after beating the game there still plenty more to be done with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved as well as its multi player missions this is stand out game despite being quite old now in video game years it still good game that you can pick up play whenever you feel the need to get little more bond in your life even now just thinking about it ve got the theme song stuck in my head such great cast and well written storyline br br the story comes to life on the screen almost as if the actors were their in front of you and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself superbly done in true bond fashion which can only be named awesome completely awesome br br ve gotta go throw this game on now if you haven played it yet you re missing out &#39;,
 &#39; commented on this when it first debuted and gave it thumbs in the middle review remarking that d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode ve seen total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006 and as lifelong batman fanatic can say without hesitation this show is utter crap br br everything wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories br br and for god sake is it just me or is the joker in every episode is gotham that much of revolving door justice system or again is it just complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development above br br and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same 3 part formula br br 1 joker gasses people br br 2 joker sets out to gas the whole city br br 3 batman saves the day br br pfeh br br there was one episode saw that wasn a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster the think thank thunk episode with the quiz show that was the single worst batman story ve ever seen heard or read yes worse than ve got batman in my basement br br can really say what feel this show is because it probably against the tos but it starts with and rhymes with fastardization thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc era of bat entertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and should have known this just couldn possibly have lasted forever unfortunately &#39;,
 &#39; just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid if your child likes this film you better have him her tested am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad this film is showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else the writing is horrid can remember when ve heard such bad dialogue the songs are beyond wretched the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much who decided to employ joey fatone he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin br br the worst thing is the obviousness of it all it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible great children movies are wicked smart and full of wit films like shrek and toy story in recent years willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past but in the continual dumbing down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo yes that right the recent charlie the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood &#39;,
 &#39; what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from wobbly garbled beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout br br our movie begins in the woods of country somewhere in the world family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father separates from the mother and their childen you get real sense of what kind of movie you re about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like very unsupervised unsafe stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them he too gives stern warning before action in the form of bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred br br so now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if you re honest about the hero age to beautiful turkey where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves or diamond prospectors or something ingred works at diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty drives around the desert in his denim outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as you know its shame you re my sister he says to her while she stark naked make for very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf renewal of hope occurs when bo finds girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is real fan of ethical grey areas and he is overjoyed with his new love br br so anyway there a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer williamson for some reason and big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special really special so heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire you may be glad you did or not &#39;,
 &#39; if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is reality for number of reasons one many of the world freighters are of questionable registry nationality and it difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don have an office in real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than fresh coat of paint anyway it fascinating reading br br horrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top 5 contenders usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinema br br loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee also as usual loved omar epps &#39;,
 &#39; in all honesty haven seen this film for many years but the few times have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand first saw it as child at ymca halloween party in the early sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in fun way remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze can risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to movie in film history and yet oddly moving in way you have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days don know if it available on home video or not but it would still make great halloween feature for both kids and adults &#39;,
 &#39; you think you re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights br br reda father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he can drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his son protest to get him there in their broken down vehicle br br but reda doesn see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of pals br br the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differences br br it perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination br br it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are don miss this and yes book early was pleasantly surprised that this evening session was still full house &#39;,
 &#39; firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons br br 1 host steve martin was at his most wittiest saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and ll better not mention the gay mafia in case wake up with poodle head in my bed br br 2 surprise winners no one had adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeers and boos but they won br br last year award ceremony wasn too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn the best in the trilogy fellowship was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers br br chris rock wasn too bad but he no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble sports hall with seats put in not much of glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats there no such thing as minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they re as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium what bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves br br best supporting actress cate blanchett no great surprise for competitive category br br best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of america greatest living character actors br br best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn br br best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night br br best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he never won one actually m glad about this because if he didn deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or goodfellas he didn deserve it for the aviator br br best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it dead cert for best picture while mdb controversial subject matter would have turned lot of voters off br br what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven done in the past mean beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd sake and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts &#39;,
 &#39; while in plane flicking through the large choice of movies came across live almost accidentally oh boy what choice br br remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about stupid reality show now can easily say this has been hell of ride don remember last time have been so excited terrified not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching climax where you can turn away from the screen literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you ve got br br you will first go through personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show you will drift from thinking how come the human being can be so vicious to why not after all ask yourself would you do it then learn about the contestants their motives and start guessing you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe br br good acting good directing with movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more br br spoilers couple of things would have changed br br the casting of the contestants have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had bit more like him the idea of rich writer who wants to be famous is bit stupid it felt like you didn care about some of the contestants although this might have been done on purpose think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants game rules big glitch br br what happens if the 5th contestants doesn die when he pulls the trigger do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself they should have given chance to all contestants to live ie if 5th is blank too then no one dies br br interestingly haven been bothered too much by this bad points cause really had good time just wish had some popcorn with me &#39;,
 &#39; feel dumber after watching the first 20 min luckily walked out and saved the rest of my brain people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly not because of the budget of the film or the special effects just simply good acting and getting simple things right and most importantly not being lame but guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not clue of what is good movie don be scared of rating films low save your under appreciated high scores for once in life time movies keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions don spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace love &#39;,
 &#39; this has got to be the worst movie haver ever seen nielson in this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual but when you put him in movie where he has to be funny he isn the movie had only one good part and this may be considered spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated if the whole movie had been animated it might have been good had no intention of seeing this movie when saw the ads for it and the only reason did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in radio contest this is the first and probably only movie have ever walked out on on scale of 1 10 give this movie score of 100 &#39;,
 &#39; okay ve watched this movie twice now have researched it heavily on the net have asked several people on there opinions have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla book that this movie is supposed to be based on feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesn seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the book br br laura lives in castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get letter from the general man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile chance encounter with strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with laura condition and the general br br have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are even have catchy name and would have jingle too but can be bothered with that it called the this movie doesn make any sense game br br all you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with complete plot that explains what is happening mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely complete br br it will have to answer such questions as br br why can vampires walk around in day light br br why are they all lesbians br br why is girl called bob and why does she shoot herself br br when is the movie dream and when is it real br br why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn make anyone bat an eyelid br br why does travis fontaine spot and run down zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is zombie too br br and why does he then let girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car br br and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in stolen car br br what the hell is the asylum scene all about br br what the hell is the green goo all about br br why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like nurse br br why are there never any vampires fighting zombies br br what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know that br br in fact sod it it just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too br br have my plot and have to admit it is not quite there but it is pretty good effort br br in conclusion br br vampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on classic 19th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on &#39;,
 &#39; this would ve been great silent film the acting really is good at least in look ma m doing really big acting sort of way br br everything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedy br br mostly felt like gagging yet like any train wreck couldn tear my eyes away this dialogue might ve worked on the stage although doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe really bad dramatic work br br if you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pace br br this script must ve sounded lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesn work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera br br imdb does us great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computer controlled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than 1 br br character driven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isn character development your characters must have motivation being drunk for while and waking up in field is not character development that a plot contrivance br br stay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps you ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do br br oh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male look at me m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of man glory br br don say you weren warned &#39;,
 &#39; this movie starts with the main character lying in coma in hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss watched this in dvd version and have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny â it said â comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had seen this in movie theater probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny â and because they are supposed to sit in comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn br br brilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the â mechanics suppose director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over man in coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy can not for me anyway br br the main problem have with this movie is that can see reason behind the way the main characters behave could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships â if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better br br the acting is not bad udo semel actually came to like quite lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl lighter version than of venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now heard he did comedy about hitler oi vai &#39;,
 &#39; first and foremost loved the novel by ray bradbury it the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam grier br br how could it fail br br there may be spoilers within br br first of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to minimum all the visuals from the book gone everything that made you squirm gone br br and then there the acting like lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasn addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces br br you think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here it like they just don care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances br br pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn well pulled off she a lot less evil and doesn have the presence as she did in the book br br and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jim house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merry go round the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more br br and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merry go round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything br br could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil don see this movie but read the book it a classic of bradbury &#39;,
 &#39; had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas having reserved special slot for it last night sat down to watch it with my daughter aged 17 and film studies student with chocolates of course in eager anticipation we love jane austin br br after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk the shaky camera shots and angles general poor cinematography direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied despondent we viewed on br br anne played by sally hawkins looked oddly and with no particular purpose directly at the camera on several occasions breaking our hard won fantasy of the moment and engaging us directly in an almost ll find you stalking fashion br br poor rupert penry jones who played captain wentworth did his best with the script and direction bless him hope they paid him well however as he was practically drowned on one occasion by huge wave which predictably breached the seawall drenching him and his co actor they were nearly swept out to sea health and safety would have had field day poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for re shoot of this scene anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such day in the first place br br other than mr penry jones alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott br br towards the long awaited end of the film captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie it was as if he had developed memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being in contrast anne ran hyper ventilating from pillar to post in search of the good captain who in the meantime had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told in the course of only three or four minutes without even having worked up sweat br br we experienced none of anne charms crossing the screen indeed we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain spineless opinion less anne and why someone anyone did not tell mean winging sir walter to just shut the heck up br br the crucial kiss normally our favourite girlie moment was painfully drawn out as they moved in closer anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met eww br br the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been br br what pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story filmed in some of england finest scenery br br sorry jane &#39;,
 &#39; rather silly little film you just may love br br although rather corny and clichã at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun five teams are engaged on scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best team br br notable for several screen debuts including david naughton first film role after his dr pepper be pepper commercials and before his major 1981 hit american werewolf in london also features paul ruebens in what believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll year before he became known for it and last but not least mr spin city and alex keaton himself michael fox gets his first film role here fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house outside of that no names but all funny characters br br doubt it has ever made it to dvd but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on late late show sometime if you do is worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become quirky little movie you come to love &#39;,
 &#39; this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown can say it is novel or very good but they made movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though the movie is pretty long but at the end was feeling like some things were missing sound effects and sound tracks were very good acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak for people who didn read the book things may look happening too quickly from my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and using the time not in good way these are main problems of the movie so it is worth watching but could have been done better &#39;,
 &#39; what can say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason even watched this film that had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian mcshane br br was not disappointed in the least ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role he always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actor br br as for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly weren being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them br br was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul performance though must admit have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie br br the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expected clear cut by the numbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie clearly wasn watching the film closely enough this film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is the idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over coffee certainly did br br no car chases no explosions no bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that was completely absorbed by the film and it just well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved br br warning if you re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly br br you might not enjoy this film &#39;,
 &#39; killer cannibal rapist is killed by crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going little crazy about the scum of the city and has drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds bit confusing really but no its just rubbish br br the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasn for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness would probably have fallen asleep there is bit of gore but it never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also half decent scene where the killer falls in love with sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing have ever seen in film it is just plastic toy on fishing line br br the ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make sequel br br 4 10 &#39;,
 &#39; in 1929 director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disney laugh gram cartoon series however their friendship suffered tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasn really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color br br 1937 skeleton frolics is essentially remake of the 1929 classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show that about to begin as group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play happy tune now it not easy to be musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra it hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their graves br br directed and animated by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesn mean it necessarily better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all br br however it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denat tune is effective and appropriate for the theme it easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling song has unique personality that makes it unforgettable being musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk flawless work of animation personally think that with better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as it still fun film to watch br br it kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disney main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films it was probably just case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just can help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerk skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us br br 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; yes indeed it could have been good movie love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical it a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious &#39;,

 &#39; oh my goodness would have never thought it was possible for me to see thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon but here it is armed with rotten plot terrible editing stilted acting and headache inducing style sorry have no other words for it sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre that is this film is so bad that even the thrillers condemned as complete failures now seem little better br br now not only sanctimony is terrible film in itself it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do pathetic job with it right from the main titles nothing but blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se7en was under the impression that something didn smell quite right as soon as the movie started with series of corny wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors knew where that smell was coming from br br it turns out that two policemen or rather policeman jim renart michael parã and policewoman dorothy smith jennifer rubin are investigating on murder spree in vancouver serial killer known as monkey killer what menacing chilling nickname uh for his working methods has killed quite lot of people you see this nut apparently works following the proverb see no evil hear no evil speak no evil and cuts eyes ears and tongues out of his victims so far six eyes six ears and three tongues in very ingenious fashion renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people well because he probably wants to complete the number 666 so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick casper van dien young successful good looking businessman with dreadful temper and that where the rip off of american psycho kicks in br br so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath none of which is interesting in the least until they finally meet along the way to that disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory renart goes in the back of the disco club because well just because the script tells us it a suspect place then with one single punch in the stomach renard gets rid of big guard who blocks the path and the guard is never heard of again does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic br br anyway after another murder gerrick turns in as witness but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer in typical basic instinct fashion smith gets some dates with the young businessman under the assumption that she might discover his true identity br br won spoil the ending but it is quite simply an embarrassment there are contradictions some plot holes issues that never get resolved and especially there is one last scene where brutal mass murder supposed to be shocking and sad comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that frankly can imagine how anyone could not laugh at it br br at 87 minutes sanctimony is really pushing it you never care about one single character because they are all so flat not to mention boring that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them you are never pulled into the story because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place the acting ranges from average van dien to downright atrocious rubin and most of the supporting cast the music is abysmal generic techno and the photography is one of the worst have ever seen of course like every fiasco of the genre we are provided with little bit of gratuitous nudity br br 3 10 &#39;,

 &#39; this movie starred totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radio baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however 7 1 2 decades later it being billed as three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts br br as for the stooges this is film from there very early days before mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you ll see what mean and the rest is history within year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was common occurrence at mgm great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in wide variety of odd film roles including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didn act as team they just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the piano br br this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl could really see why he never made successful transition to films as he has the personality of slug but slightly less welcome as for durante never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat br br in this film the stooges they didn yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly br br overall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the 13 minute mark you will see brief scene where tour guide on bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in role you certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of so called pre code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title it a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything it quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the 63 minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back few decades see the film you ll see that mean &#39;,
 &#39; when carol vanessa hidalgo starts looking into her brother death she begins to suspect something more sinister than natural causes the closer she gets to the truth the more of threat she becomes to her sister in law fiona helga line and the rest of the local satanists they ll do whatever is necessary to put stop her nosy ways br br if you re into sleazy satanic themed movies black candles has lot to offer the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex one scene in particular involving young woman and goat must be seen to be believed unfortunately all the sleaze in the world can save black candles most of the movie is total bore other than the one scene ve already mentioned the numerous sex scenes aren shocking and certainly aren sexy the acting is spotty at best even genre favorite helga line gives disappointing performance the plot really doesn matter its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror black candles comes off as amateurish 3 10 is about the best can do &#39;,
 &#39; ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so let focus on the movie and the message br br have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years and for family movie for the average adult male 2 out of 10 br br like pop rock music m 45 know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until read the credits and these reviews didn recognise her poster on the wall so was not worried about any self promotion br br watch movies to be entertained don care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain me br br watched this movie for the message the world greatest epidemic is low self esteem which is whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don give up message so yeh it was bit predictable great message though should be more of them br br this movie is great family movie but for bloke watching by himself get hannibal &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand ri chard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at all they are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro it as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color it just so weird this could be great movie and should be re made but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction &#39;,
 &#39; steve mcqueen has certainly lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen can save this turkey of film shot with what looks like brownie camera in the actual locations in st louis br br mcqueen a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of bank heist by one of the other gang there more than broad hint that there a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke he not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume br br steve also has girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions aroused br br the great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steve performance was best served by doing bad marlon brando imitation br br this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen m willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because can believe they would have if they saw this br br or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey &#39;,
 &#39; this is bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts as result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are fan of pre code films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out even if they aren married and even if their partner is br br the film begins with miss dunne as social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes he not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded to almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time br br surprisingly this entire plot involving stillborn baby and cabot ends about 1 4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to it was as if they filmed part of movie and abandoned it tacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at women prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate and as result of all this violence miss dunne goes on crusade to clean up the prison and becomes reformer and famous writer br br but then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the women prison reform business goes by the wayside dunne meets judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as very good girl even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while she pregnant with his love child he indicted for being crooked judge he assures her he innocent but he convicted and it sure sounds like he a scoundrel using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released the film then ends br br so we basically have three separate films and bizarre early 30s idea of what nice girl should be like gathered that she should be strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really undoes all the positives about dunne character and it really hard to imagine anyone liking the film strong women rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with decent re write this could have been good film or at least interesting as lewd and salacious film but it couldn make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film &#39;,
 &#39; caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as list horror suspense films go two guys one naive and one loud mouthed take road trip to stop wedding but have the worst possible luck when maniac in freaky make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them things are further complicated when they pick up ridiculously whorish hitchhiker what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie unlike so many others the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff definitely worth checking out &#39;,
 &#39; shall begin with disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audience knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and promise it ll be that much better br br with that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with sense of awe br br believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation br br once again myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like dance br br in short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy 7 this film will blow you out of the water if you re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience br br finally just want to make note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery br br square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves br br thanks square enix the wait was well worth it &#39;,
 &#39; if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors eating non ants and conquering the world with voice over narrative then this is the movie for you basically couple of scientists working out of bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination throughout the movie the two scientists and girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their disposal computers green dye and horrid acting but to no avail guess they just couldn afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly br br the title of the movie phase iv is something of mystery this is not spoiler but phase starts right after the opening credits whereas you don reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases 1 3 throughout the movie as kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as mst3k episode this one wasn very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even tb can lighten it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing 5 gamera movies br br the movie does have trick surprise ending but was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me &#39;,

 &#39; this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features good cast of british actors so what went wrong don know and simply don care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently need to write ten lines of text in this review so might as well detail the plot nob of man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twists devices should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film &#39;,
 &#39; ll not comment lot what to stereotype characters absolute ignorance about colombia reality awful mise en scene poor color choice not funny it supposed to be comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it beside the nonsense scenes very poor actors direction if you see somewhere those people mean the interpreters you ll know they are at least good but seeing this so call film it is impossible to guess it you get tired of the music this comedy has no rhythm the only good rhythm in it it the rap sing in the final credits pathetic doesn it etc etc it has been long time haven seen movie so bad &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is riot cannot remember the last time had such great time at the movies ve seen few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines think best in show is the last movie that laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that it a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all in br br as far as the actual film goes it could have used better edit it choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great it not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke think will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed she not 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite br br if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre ones br br oh and one more thing hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies don get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don put it on their list this means you ebert &#39;,
 &#39; fey story of martian attempt to colonize earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of reported ufo crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to nearby diner br br the diner has had no customers since eleven clock that morning now there are handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross structurally weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didn notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect there the crazy old man jack elam of course who seems to exercise sub rosa wit there a blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly minted husband could have sworn you had mole on your chin the story continues in sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriously br br it a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth chuckle there is no discernible depth to it it not moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens it not warning of any kind just fairy tale that diverts and amuses br br always enjoy it when it on it especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in 1954 he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm version of shakespeare play and here he is with three arms br br oops &#39;,
 &#39; despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie &#39;,

 &#39; such joyous world has been created for us in pixar a bug life we re immersed in universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer â when it in the right hands that is â bug life is warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling and sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions br br it is only pixar second animated feature the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in 1995 with their landmark movie toy story it was movie which defied convention re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film br br after all it a film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in bug life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of movie let alone provide the entire premise of feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you ll probably ever encounter br br not only are they all entirely amiable and likable â there isn an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters â but they re colourful they re eclectic and they re idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto bug life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season harvest with his antics br br the problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of better term hopper offers proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack hands however it a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in flik mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers br br if you think about it bug life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line of akira kurosawa classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies â one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in bug life the help comes in the form of down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in bar room brawl br br much amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and quasi femme fatale ladybug who in fact gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper it exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen as is the entire movie collectively br br as ve said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall dazzling movie what makes bug life even better is that the film isn restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film â the clichã kid friendly situations are bit more abundant than we like however it easy to ignore this fault and it incredulously easy to enjoy this film br br although bug life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that they re not just one hit wonder but instead much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards it only always by themselves what more is there to say about bug life other than see it it not quite the best which we ve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year â and ll be damned if this isn the best animated feature of 1998 br br 8 5 10 &#39;,
 &#39; what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever anyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to contemporary setting and in musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for rainy day maybe the direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was director for hire and didn instill the project with the passion that it deserved &#39;,
 &#39; this animation has very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why don they use this rotoscopic technique more these days it quite effective br br fire and ice in it prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore it esthetic quality for sure did not mind bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in cool world and don think he has to apoligize since it pretty much animation for adults but had also enjoyed this animation as child and never forgot it br br this one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it possibly bakshi finest for those who like animations with lushious women try space adventure cobra as well br br give fire and ice 8 out of 10 &#39;,

 &#39; can stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton and sure it his company but you re fired or you re hired for how many seasons now after watching the show wouldn want to work for the guy with his ego and all and think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve br br d love to hear just one person get up and say donald quit and take some of your money and buy decent hairdo see he even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe hope he gets hurt so don have to see his pathetic face anymore it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it d give this show negative mark if could but it gets 1 and it doesn deserve that &#39;,
 &#39; the story and the show were good but it was really depressing and hate depressing movies ri chard is great he really put on top notch performance and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous seriously thought she was carmen electra until saw the imdb profile can say anything bad about peter galleghar he one of my favorite actors love anne rice m currently reading the vampire chronicles but m glad saw the movie before reading the book this is little too real for me prefer lestat and louis witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me could barely stand to watch the rest of the show sorry for the ambiguity but don want to give anything away sorry but it just not my type of show &#39;,
 &#39; first let me just comment on what liked about the movie the special effects were fantastic and very rarely did feel like was watching video game there that is the last nice thing have to say about this film in fact would just like everyone reading this to take note that can even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing br br have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming mile away where lois 5 year old son turns out to be the super powered child of superman when the crying super child throws piano at lex henchman to save his mother almost got up and left the theater singer could have made much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like seemingly fragile but latently super powered illegitimate child it been 5 days since saw the movie and still want to vomit br br my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space it doesn take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what wrong with that don know how many comic books brian singer has read but when superman is exposed to even small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet whoever had the idea to have him fly large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman related projects ever again the concept is as ridiculous as making dracula movie where the title character has stake through his heart and still manages to fly spaceship made out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas that not any more absurd then having him hoist continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground br br my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of god like jor el sent to earth to be savior jor el wasn all wise he was just scientist and he didn send his son to earth to be savior he threw him in rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode ll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into brick until m too brain dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman returns the passion of the christ br br and speaking of luthor my last major complaint has to do with singer depiction of lex luthor lex luthor is shrewd cold hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world the man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman returns as well as all the previous superman movies is wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singer next project can be batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show zam whap pow br br to summarize don know what hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you don hate this movie then your opinion is wrong sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven already don see it don buy it when it comes out on dvd don rent it basically don contribute any money towards it in any way this movie does not deserve to make any money in fact think that for every person that sees this movie bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars if you re superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you ll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of the best tv productions of musical ever have heard the merman cast album the angela lansbury album have seen tyne daly live and ve seen the rosalind russell movie countless times think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of mama rose was never natalie wood fan so really enjoyed cynthia gibb in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three strippers led by the always dependable christine ebersole are hard to top there was supposed to be tv production of mame few years back with cher but think bette would be the best bet pun intended for auntie mame &#39;,
 &#39; am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of c grade porn movie with one major difference no porn br br the story and dialogue needs complete overhaul maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked up br br while accept that this had low budget and the director did good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just pointless br br it was complete waste of my time &#39;,
 &#39; overall was rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create science fiction version of the c but this fear is rectified when terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that very rarely see television tackle br br bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed think if you are fan of the two just mentioned or other films television shows which deal with the subjects referenced think you will find at least something here br br in terms of starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about believe they handled it in very interesting way especially liked how they explained where the cylon belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers br br the only real weak points noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays lacy rand while like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something think needs work also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident br br based on the pilot greatly look forward to seeing where caprica goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did &#39;,
 &#39; m the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season from the grade to the hollywood but this movie was something different am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasn to good compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz quite good and ice in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt ice kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice and the other dude this kills the jamaican however ice is unharmed very similar to ice other movie urban menace which stars both of these actors were snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like demon when mj silkk gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh with out blood and when mj confesses killing cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird benny isn introduced in this movie and the scene isn in the film it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes scratch your head wen jody writes letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn mention what happen 2 other main characters mj and lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide was good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing helmet and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was ok tho but me being from poverty love hood films however if don love em like do don watch it only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie made which was made with 100 dollars and my love of the genre br br nathaniel purez &#39;,
 &#39; you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed that why movies like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones we live on tiny island and cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning set of wheels which come with 100 tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the sea br br and these movies are relatively easy to make hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic for once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long can compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without leggy model in frame however they don warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park the guy sitting beside me swear he wet his pants every time his dream car appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans br br so there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage as does the gt here the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification that even m impressed alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that has wings for doors but seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time they re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they can br br there no story in redline just excuses to put together movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator mind you tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steering wheels gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that they re the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks not very tall order for an actor and that why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids br br the heroine yes it made statement that girls can drive natasha very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds girl with model looks who don mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts lubricants and going for rides introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by gangsta called infamous eddie griffin she gets drawn into family squabbles involving leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle everything else well like said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race br br and it almost always the same as there very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors and will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker sun kang and of course the star it created vin diesel redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately it looks like tv movie in its treatment from the get go with very insipid opening sequence where it one man one car and 105 minutes race against time to get to vegas br br if not for the cars then this movie seriously is piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines &#39;,
 &#39; seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt bullitt has beginning that builds builds builds when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his mustang which is parked under the embarcadero freeway now torn down and notices the charger sitting nearbye you know you are about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed adding to it is terrific lalo schriffin if remember correctly sound track this goes on for long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing that shot of mcqueen mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact hickman look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect then of course san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends also bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still hot mustang gt and dodge charger made for better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when was doing movie reviews for paper they gave it good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups had few jumps over little hills yawn but of course they were not san francisco hills the seven ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt but the scene of single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity strictly hollywood would say except that it was filmed in new york &#39;,
 &#39; ok m italian but there aren so many italian film like this think that the plot is very good for 3 4 of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but it the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack d like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but it only great theater italian actor called toni servillo yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it too slow it so boring so many silences but think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between very talented young girl the grand daughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films &#39;,

 &#39; the first cube movie was an art movie it set up world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of hostile world that they couldn understand it was on the non literal level man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face new indefinable world beyond man petty squabbles world where there were no more struggle but peace rated cube 10 out of 10 and it a movie that was never meant to have any sequels br br the second movie hypercube was massive disappointment some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning still for being fairly entertaining rated it 5 out of 10 br br the third movie cube zero while ignoring the second plays like vastly inferior commercial movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off the same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is rip off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say br br that we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed where the bleep is the sense in that that just flippin stupid m glad didn pay to see this br br the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me rating of 3 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this is movie that can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it it has lot of laughs guns action crime good one liners and decent plot with an over the top donald sutherland in rather comedic role as an assasain tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character max dea agent diane is the fbi agent played by carerra and john lithgow from frazier on tv plays the bad guy livingston the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies throw into the mix the assassain sutherland who pretty much has all the good one liners this is the perfect crime caper there is the usual love story but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith you also have the russian mafia italian mafia and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix the film is shot in boston where you have some great shots and locals great photography and music in this film this movie is just the epitome of crime comedy it has everything that one could ever want check out sutherland toilet in particular scene very unusual this film is riot and will make you laugh real hard 10 plus for me &#39;,

 &#39; thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotional especially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie personally like the empire strikes back lot also but think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as did with the third movie br br it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as whole have heard many strange reasons such as because yoda died because bobba fett died because small ewoks defeated band of stormtroopers because darth vader was revealed br br would like to debunk each of these reasons because believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die don get me wrong am fan of bobba fett but he made few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett name judging rotj because minor character died is bit much think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was momentous period in the movie was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys can stay alive in realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in new hope many consider new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wan death okay but yoda not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in new hope where there were several scenes of group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against legion of stormtroopers don believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star br br the last reason that care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father face because it made it complete by annakin revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact that is what would have done in that scene too if were luke father isn that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in mechanized helmet br br on another note think subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves never go into film with that deception in mind always try to go into film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but can not know for sure let see that way go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that clearly superior film is not as good as it really was br br am not sure who criticizes these movies but have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that new hope was their favorite that it is rotj believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading br br bottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes there was not moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day br br finally hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately br br &#39;,
 &#39; crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman agreement which it beat to theatres by few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying it because m jewish isn it it much easier to get the message that hate is like loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the warners dvd doesn mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from homophobic murder to an anti semitic one but it interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish there little doubt in sam levene performance that the character is in fact also gay â not mincing caricature but there definitely two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper confused soldier there not much of mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy br br there an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of fix you could almost see that aspect as blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long sweltering night the film has great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert young maigret like detective gloria grahame tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert ryan excellent performance as guy who could do with good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row big surprise hit in 1946 as reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac which itself had notable tendency to target jews so much for crusadingâ &#39;,
 &#39; this movie basically is very well made production and gives good impression of war situation and its effects on those involved it always interesting to see the story from the other side for change this movie concentrates on group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought br br it interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the villains in this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you re fighting against at first it kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german are the evil villains but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in them br br the way this story is told isn however the best it hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isn always logic in its storytelling and features bit too many sequences that remain too vague it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who it doesn always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies br br the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasn even shot in russia itself it helps to create good war time situation atmosphere br br the character are mostly interesting although perhaps tad bit formulaic but don know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism it also helps that they re being played by well cast actors all of the actors aren the best known actors around thomas kretschmann was also at the time still fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality br br all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth look due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values br br 7 10 &#39;,
 &#39; so rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert book hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor so figured from ebert saying that would see if it was really as bad as he said it was know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but could not express how much hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert review of rob reiner north where he said he hated that movie ten times had ever heard such brilliant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfuss as gangster which don think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well but above all the other things that were awful about this movie can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss girlfriend while dreyfuss was at criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits but after that first 4 or 5 minutes the other 85 minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for 30 seconds then someone gets shot then there are whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra my way sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss of course because the screenplay was written on the level of sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny can certainly tell you did not care or find that funny not only am disappointed in dreyfuss who admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that independence day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history did goldblum feel that independence day would be flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if independence day were bomb what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time says that the movie is set on another planet only wish now that have wasted 93 minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of 93 minutes out of my life that will never get back ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough am afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire have yet to top worst movie have ever seen because this one has won it honor as the worst movie ever &#39;,
 &#39; what boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter in law karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasn too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity person can take let alone three bloody hours of it br br the best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was piece of crap &#39;,
 &#39; this had great cast with big name stars like tyrone power henry fonda randolph scott nancy kelly henry hull and brian donlevey and bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles it also had technicolor one of the few movies made with it in 1939 br br now the bad news regrettably can say much positive for the story it portrayed the james boys in totally positive light and hollywood has done that ever since why these criminals are always shown to be the good guys is beyond me this film glamorizes them and made their enemies the railroad people into vicious human beings the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous well that the film world for you evil is good good is bad br br hey hollywood here a news flash the james boys were criminals really look it up &#39;,
 &#39; remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by clannad still have their legend album loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors m sure robin and his men would have young after all people didn live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin granddad the only sad thing was the ending it a shame they couldn at least have done one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it happier ending &#39;,
 &#39; don normally write reviews but this film was special couldn turn it off don believe ve ever seen worse movie but there sat watching it was like horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway it was disgusting but couldn turn away where do start the movie seems to think it a sports thriller but it so utterly ridiculous it can only be comedy but it not funny not even in dumb silly way it like watching your cousins try to act out skit on family get togethers it painful to watch but at least it only for minute or two second string went on for over an hour br br whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible the problem is can describe how bad it was you just had to see it and m sure this will never be shown again so unless you saw it you re out of luck mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film ve seen over my lifetime and for every film see in the future that can stand will think to myself well at least it wasn bad as the second string &#39;,
 &#39; few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability br br no too many are focused on john lassiter amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as genius but digress br br miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies children br br that said am at loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else are you going to have film where three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthralled 7 year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus 12 year old my nephew aaron who review was of course it was good everything miyazaki san does is good 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and 58 year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and m betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child characters br br and that is what respect most about miyazaki san he seems to speak to his audience in completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be seen as simple story about little fish girl who gets taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo mother soske mother the older ladies in nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed br br but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her magical fish but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination br br once human she teams up with her friend soske whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes he related to the jonas brothers can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines his character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics you re not likely to find in child character on this side of the pacific br br in the end ponyo father fujimoto must cope with his daughter decision and his estranges wife wishes to allow her to be human he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuses to allow character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable no one in real life is completely bad person all humans are various shades of gray and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters br br and then there the animation itself in time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was hand drawn and for one was extremely grateful for that the character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lip sync going on quite unusual for an anime film the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like br br in the end found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazaki best in my opinion that honor is still held by kiki delivery service but still 10 star fun movie for the entire family &#39;,
 &#39; watched this movie on tv last night hoping for realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease was disappointed and think the movie was garbage it did not seem real to me some of the acting was awful in particular that of the doctor she was about the worst ve seen the whole thing played like cnn worst case scenario even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn seem sincere have seen some disaster movies in particular those weather ones which are actually so bad they are amusing this one is almost as bad but it is not even amusing it is tedious and boring don bother with this one &#39;,
 &#39; for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings who love film have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny smartly written dialogue then this is film for you br br for those with poor attention span high expectations and no brains well um you may get bored and find things dragging at times br br this is charming modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing real sense of depth and warmth to their roles chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through br br this film is little gem &#39;,
 &#39; the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in year when most movergoers were stay at homes watching their new 7 motorola televisions almost all recent box office figures are false because they fail to adjust inflation obviously today 10 movies will dominate in 1951 it cost 90c to 1 60 at radio city 44c to 75c first run at loew palace in washington dc or 35c to 50c in neighborhood runs what counts is the number of people responding to the picture not unadjusted box office media spin the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso really not great story anyway and threw it in the trash instead 90 of the movie focus was on the music thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso the result was wonderful movie too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating too fat to play the student prince edmund purdom took his place with lanza voice dubbed in and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising if you want to see the great caruso it almost always on ebay for 2 00 or less don be put off by the low price as it reflects only the easy availability of copies not the quality of the movie &#39;,
 &#39; the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may oliver person too talented for this film didn like wheeler sentiment can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in revolution in small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friends which greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is national pastime br br am huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood the silent era through the 1940s have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey can help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofy surely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of piece of cheese piece of cheese that sang very poorly missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as who on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routine so prematurely that you are left frustrated knew that who on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it fair shot and give it their own twist br br once again have found yet another sub par film by this duo while must admit that liked few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakers which actually gave 6 to on imdb this one was major endurance test to complete something that find happens all too often when view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor &#39;,
 &#39; first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and guess it actually works because that the reason why bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isn any good actually it bloody awful but didn expect anything else when bought it it a low budget horror movie with chupacabra monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaad br br this movie has some of the worst acting have ever seen the actors try to hard and it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say line in normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it so stupid it almost looks like freakin parody it like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play bimbo she the worst of them all have never seen an actor as bad as her and ve seen pteradactyl even when her boyfriend dies she can stop being bimbo about it hate her br br some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but that the way like it the chupacabra looks pretty messed up and it easy to see that it a guy in suit br br overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer &#39;,
 &#39; found this movie to be very good in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters especially ms stone and morissey tramell character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute the plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie before it even started you won regret it if you go see it &#39;,
 &#39; stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollie clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with car in front of large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and little predictable classic comedy it isn great but it a black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians comedian okay &#39;,
 &#39; was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80 i was born on may 14th 1994 despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80 when other kids had playstations was playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds special place in my heart already despite me being only 15 years old at the time of writing this review because of my 80 style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest too br br it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunk adoptive father is in rush to get to the airport as he is going on business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at local cafã the chipmunks are playing game of around the world in 30 days against the chipettes brittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by crocodile alvin get in an argument with brittany about who would really win race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up race around the world where each team will have to deposit doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive doll in the opposing team likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive 100 000 dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins great adventure this film is classic and see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and top notch voice acting not to mention the kick ass music pardon my french my favorite song is without shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped it also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting lucky kind of suggestive for kid film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky first didn think anything of it but when grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film it one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4 feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince very small but important role the ending is of course happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his 100 000 dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to black br br classic ending by the way hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you haven seen this flick give it watch it worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80 gets solid 10 out of 10 br br headin for the top don you know we never stop believing now &#39;,
 &#39; just when thought would finish whole year without giving single movie bomb rating friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night feared the worst knowing its reputation and it was as god awful as d anticipated this is mexican made mess dubbed into english and produced by gordon murray it got terrible sets and effects and features rather frightening santa who doesn operate at the north pole but instead from cloud in outer space and who doesn have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is the opening sequence where st nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in variety of languages seems to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesn observe the child labor laws br br eventually we get some nasty and slinky red suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth just to make little kids naughty and turn santa christmas eve rounds into nightmare watching this movie is trippy and twisted experience and it bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever oddly the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie ve ever seen but m sure that nothing unique &#39;,
 &#39; as is often the case when you attempt to take 400 plus page book and cram it into two hour film lot is lost here director john madden shakespeare in love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off what we get is charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete br br there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john toll cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall winning oscars for both is splendid working with madden the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous br br madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isn much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated while the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features br br nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switches gears seamlessly into man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas br br penelope cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as pelagia in part this is because cage so dominates the screen but cruz just seems too placid in part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic she allows the character to be objectified as corelli love interest rather than establishing her as powerful character in her own right br br john hurt gives fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine however christian bale seems bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia fiancã br br rated this film an 8 10 despite some drawbacks this is touching film that is well worth seeing the photography alone is worth the price of admission &#39;,
 &#39; in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included if you don like burt you may still like this if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time being from atlanta it does hit home but it also nice to see cop action drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city chicago miami or la the film is funny at points with good plot good performances from great supporting cast every character is real the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out nice offbeat romance in the 2nd half it has some good old fashion shootouts fistfights no cgi thank god real action br br if clint eastwood did his best impression of burt reynolds movie with every which way but loose any which way you can then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this it comes off great &#39;,
 &#39; have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict love story about people who happen to be african americans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see film where the story line centered on young professional african americans this is virtually an untapped market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of warm creamy hot chocolate with splash of kahlua and butterscotch if you hadn guessed loved it &#39;,
 &#39; holes is an awesome movie love it lot and it one of my favorite films it one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn cheesy holes is generally very cool motion picture wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool don get the wrong idea don mean to bad mouth disney but most of it stuff is aimed towards kids and that okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes it the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it corny really it the kind of movie that even lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to br br holes does good job of being mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living little on the edge hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this &#39;,
 &#39; worst dcom have seen ever well maybe not as bad as smart house this was just bad the acting and story was fine but the effects sucked br br they were so fake the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen that was probably the only scene in which was excited br br overall found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly br br will give it four for brenda song who is very funny actress and that one fight scene br br 4 10 &#39;,
 &#39; have recently seen this production on dvd it is the first time have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as remembered at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and suppose it is little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been am bit of jane eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is faithful to the book as this one have recently re read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly br br all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the rivers family and their connection to jane altogether also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctly br br the casting is perfect zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book small plain and dark and disagree that she looked too old timothy dalton may be little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable oh to be loved by man like that there were couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks br br finally if you never see another production of jane eyre you simply most see this one it is simply perfection &#39;,
 &#39; in time of bad if not plain awful comedies king of queens is more than just breath of fresh air it a complete oxygen tank it is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times nothing has been this good since married with children kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses and believe me it takes lot to make me label someone as comic genius these guys truly understand what is funny could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn get half the laughs from seeing koq just once other funny people in this show are carrie janet heffernan spence and doug pruzan carrie boss m so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem the show has been hilarious winner in time of mostly comic losers check it out if you haven &#39;,
 &#39; prey br br aspect ratio 1 37 1 br br sound format mono br br lesbian couple sally faulkner and glory annan living in remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of young man barry stokes who turns out to be flesh eating alien the vanguard of massive invasion br br despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing norman warren follow up to satan slave 1976 amounts to great deal more than the sum of its meager parts thanks to surprisingly complex script by max cuff apparently his only writing credit faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek browne eye catching cinematography though annan discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one or both of these doe eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and left under mysterious circumstances stokes unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray partly because faulkner has pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him creating tensions which result in climactic whirlwind of violence there an extraordinary multi layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to emasculate their clueless visitor by dressing him in women clothing though stokes alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery br br in the early scenes at least the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following violent argument with faulkner the closing sequences are quite literally gut wrenching especially annan final scene which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored what remains is still pretty vivid so brace yourselves excellent performances by the three leads bolstered by warren unobtrusive direction which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations thereby compensating for the film budgetary shortcomings originally released in the us as alien prey &#39;,
 &#39; it starts out like very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it unravels into direction less mess who is the main character is this serious film or some gregg araki esquire over the top goofy film is this skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted have no clue found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came cut good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the have have not i got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such way that actually felt like was observing the realities of that group of friends wassup felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage caveman which larry didn write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be terrible movie that didn take itself seriously wassup rockers was just plain bad &#39;,
 &#39; this is my first deepa mehta film saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its sita character presented as nita also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita sita yet what loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta not her direction the characters big and small were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end somewhat like the end of mazursky an unmarried woman they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men and one cardboard man ashok seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him carrying his invalid mother biji he seems to finally take on future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion br br ms mehta seems to fumble as director however compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of india she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in mustard field compare her to mrinal sen adoor gopalakrishnan muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants given her competent canadian production team and financial resources mehta film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middle class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in limited social space kannada malayalam and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers br br ms das ms azmi mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding ms azmi is talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors mrinal sen khandar gautam ghose paar benegal ankur brilliance notably absent in this film ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the film strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays &#39;,
 &#39; all the way though was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious br br every part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare large resemblance to the ring it was half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less was right br br why does going into the house make her come after you it doesn make sense it was poor excuse for lot of killings and no really depth was seen at all br br you can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her didn see that one coming yawns br br surely these people must have thought to oh don know carry knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie was very mildly scared and mean mildly was just crying out for the credits as they rolled exhaled short oh thank god if you haven already don waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for sequel &#39;,

 &#39; why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre other then action caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like train wreck just could not change the channel it sheer stupidity sapped my willpower its pretty telling that the cast imdb credits with this monstrosity apparently never worked again br br bad acting bad writing bad narration bad music bad hair bad cinematography it just goes on and on the movie really has nothing to recommend it if you re looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out there are tonne of other films that won require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards br br hope this film didn get money from the government for financing otherwise m never paying taxes again &#39;,

 &#39; many of the reviews and comments have read about this movie say that this is rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the story line was rather typical of clara later silents still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun clara plays happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married clara lack of modesty was shocking in the day but believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is nice showcase of clara ability to make the audience laugh &#39;,
 &#39; as the number of video nasties ve yet to see dwindles this little pile of garbage popped up on my to rent list when saw it was available br br the premise involves fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by motley crew of idiots some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given sack of money to use as bargaining chip though if he returns with the girl and all the money he gets significant cut he brought helicopter and pilot with him and wow that pilot is one of the worst actors ever granted they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood after stealing away into the jungle we learn that nearby is cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour now this fellow is just naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever ping pong balls for eyes and that pretty much it his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack and found myself muting much of those scenes br br oh did forget to mention the almost constant nudity this is probably the main reason this film was banned though there is one specific scene about one second long where the god attacks girl and pulls her guts out but it not redeeming factor for gore fans also jess franco goes beyond the usual and and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals and sadly male as well so if you want fair in terms of exploitation you got it br br can recommend this trash to anyone it not even the good bad movie it just atrociously padded trash that only video nasty fan will probably view and even then if you are making your way through the list leave this for the very last if you watch it first you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list which is certainly not true &#39;,
 &#39; rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on bike with cool gun but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays role like this too bad the movie was piece of crap it really wasted his talent judge and jury was well plain dumb gave it 3 should have gave it 2 gave it an extra star just because david keith gun was cool &#39;,
 &#39; found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it game on is funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film he failed thank god br br the film is very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won like her because she ugly the film is just bad for so many reasons the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit those two scenes made me cringe janeane character is sickeningly arrogant and guessing from her role as stand up comedienne and arch feminist is in real life too she claims that the film is anti feminist when in fact it just realistic men more often than not go for looks over personality it interesting to note her hypocrisy too she been feminist and comedienne for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of film mean come on she acted in it for heaven sake what this film was really was anti men if anything it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman character noelle br br there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent few times for good measure is that the best the script writers could come up with blimey they ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made there also truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn ugly but is actually beautiful erm was watching the same film as they were she certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one although having said that fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well she lanky and gaunt looking br br guarantee three things about this film if you ve never watched it br br you will know what the ending will be br br you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and br br you will be bored after ten minutes br br watch at your own peril &#39;,

 &#39; 1983 frightmare is an odd little film the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 30s 40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding 80s slasher genre it isn totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad ratzoff at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he shooting commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol conrad is bit of hoity toity prima donna jerk off just when you think he couldn be any more un likable the commercial director berates conrad for blowing take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visits some fans at college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die still feisty even at death door he manages to do away with despised business associate by smothering him with pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects br br it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an 80s horror film logic has no place here the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad body seated in place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husband body has called in psychic friend to try and reach conrad through seance you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasn a very nice guy in life it not much of stretch to assume that he won be any friendlier in death psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one this is where the movie falls apart endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello is anyone there are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing but again we re in an 80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad body back to its crypt where it belongs the sluggish pacing is padded out with lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder moans and groans howls etc that becomes severely annoying after while br br can really recommend frightmare to anyone who didn grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the 80s modern horror fans will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy if you came of age in that magical decade however you may get blast of nostalgia from frightmare fans of jeffrey re animator combs may also want to check it out as the future dr west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students br br will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label paired with roy ward vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible m told the film has gotten deluxe release via the fine folks at troma which seems appropriate if you re troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley &#39;,
 &#39; think that you can not imagine how these people really work before came to the studios to watch the guys work there actually thought quite the same as you do but since saw and did the work the guys on that tv show have to do have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and lot of them really can act don think that the material given to them can really show that as think this material isn very good but they are truly good so don think that you before you haven seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and shouldn have judged over them as well before met them but did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven seen them doing there job &#39;,
 &#39; group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere one had flat tire the other jeep mysteriously won start one of them takes the tire to run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend they come across nice mr slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down hermit like house which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack he warns them about davy his brother who is lurking about and isn all there of course one of them decides to venture out in search of working phone and is never seen again is it slaussen is it davy the mannequins tourist trap has the usual horror requirements jiggly big boobed girl goody two shoes girl curiosity getting the better of people and never working out but it stands apart from the rest of the 70 genre in it twist of an ending started to feel sorry for slaussen chuck conners is terrific creepy over the top performance at point in the film and you almost see the character of molly doing the same this is gem if you can find it had taped it off of cable when was younger and walking through used video store spotted vhs copy that was totally overpriced but well worth it fans of tanya roberts won be disappointed either best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup and crackers br br gave it 7 because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain &#39;,
 &#39; didn know what to except so think it was lot better not having excepted much don get my wrong its not bad short film tess nanavati is relatively new directer and writer so think she deserves lot of kudos for making this film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic is little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for really low budget film its good there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though don feel it greatly detracts for one ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much as do say go for it the gag reel was fun won spoil it but there is particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror film also done by jagged edge know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is awesome on so many levels and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on br br just remember this when you re watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies be they good or bad this is the formula that they are using this is what makes zombie movies so great br br and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know br br all in all it doesn linger there never point where you think to yourself mon get on with it it moves quick and corners nicely this is the sporty little italian number of zombie flicks br br so awful it wonderful if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek rent it buy it love it br br as great trivia note if you re watching it on dvd you ll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen underneath the musical score well that because that music was lifted straight from the trailer which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop &#39;,

 &#39; when first heard about this movie thought it would be like the duchess 2008 but when saw the first 30 minutes of the young victoria knew this wouldn just be solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot br br the only thing that really let me down are the performances emily blunt the devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is great actress and maybe picking first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable br br to me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script don know but that how feel about the movie br br but overall it a great movie about the early years of victoria with great performance from emily blunt &#39;,
 &#39; flying saucer manned literally by crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on colony founded some 25 years ago on forbidden planet what they find is robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in br br on the surface this story is pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeare tempest but this is stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it scifi film sure its the tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about br br underneath this is cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek br br anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable if it were not for the goofy retro art deco ness of 1950s sci fi props you might think you were watching 1960s piece br br this is classic of that very special sub genre of sci fi like to call 1950s sci fi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly must see for anybody interested in sci fi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek original series aired about 12 years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem had with it br br some will probably see this film simply to catch glimpse of young good looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles unfortunately nielsen performance is only average and at times down right poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other films over acts his role as well ms francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot are the stand out actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do good job the problems with the featured performances think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right &#39;,
 &#39; just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to lot of insults and name calling too br br find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is is depressing depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichã re heats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modern day uber action to smith character smart mouthed cynic with backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and few others br br robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywood latest unsuccessful attempt to create black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but don think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice perhaps blockbuster by today standards but very movie compared to true winners &#39;,
 &#39; this must have been one of the worst movies have ever seen br br have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay found them pretty bad it just wasn realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story br br maybe that distraction is the reason that did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt br br if you re shooting movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside studio instead of desert br br the action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that certainly pro for this particular movie &#39;,
 &#39; liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century he is true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such beautiful woman it her love that makes rob roy the legend but it his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love you ll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but it unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if you re not used to scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes it their skill as actors that attracts you they don rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special &#39;,
 &#39; savage island 2003 is lame movie it more like home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched don know why this movie was made have seen lot of flicks in my time and the ones really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood boil the situations were inane at best if made movie like this it would have been short really because those backwood idjits wouldn have been in the picture br br don be fooled by the cover on the v i am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable don mind movies being shot on v but if you re going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror films sans wrong turn br br have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by br br movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1 &#39;,
 &#39; adenoid hynkel lowly soldier in world war one rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania he creates an aggressive antisemitic war machine and cultivates little toothbrush moustache sound like anyone you know br br from the safety of hollywood chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini given that the united states in 1940 had more than year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe civil strife remember it was hitler who declared war on the usa not the other way round it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic br br the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly humane brave etc etc chaplin is hynkel and he also plays the jewish barber the little hero of the ghetto the tramp in all but name needless to say chaplin writes directs stars composes the music and does the catering br br in 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the third reich and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong comedian and sentimentalist chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless all this does is to humanise him when hynkel the not very warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside down aeroplane he becomes endearing rather than despicable as dictator he inspects his subordinates technical innovations which don work the parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc and these passages are meant to make us think that the real life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside in fact hynkel regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery br br in truth chaplin day had already passed when he made this ill considered polemic at heart he was still dinosaur of the silent screen check out the humour with gags like staggering up and down the street semi conscious or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings the hero schultz is meant to represent yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged but schultz looks more like character from operetta than nazi is it in any way believable that schultz figure if such had existed would say to the fuehrer face your cause is doomed to failure because it built upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz birkenau or treblinka but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age as usual chaplin thinks in terms of silent comedy set pieces loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers shaving man to the accompaniment of brahms and the globe ballet watch for the segment filmed in reverse br br paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic so hannah is quite literally too good to be true brave defiant resourceful hardworking and of course beautiful she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage gee ain i cute she asks after the barber gives her make over too cute by far is the answer she doesn come close to ringing true because chaplin has made her caricature the wouldn it be wonderful speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author too wordy too emotionally cloying br br jack oakie is great as napaloni the fascist dictator of bacteria he brings whiff of much needed comic brio to the proceedings but the film underlying weakness remains if napaloni is silly and ineffective how can we fear him and anyway the stuttering stop start of the back projected train is fine chaplinesque example of gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth br br and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of the best horror suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for you have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film will now look at them in whole new different way &#39;,
 &#39; never saw the original movie in the series only hope it was much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980 as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be pretty good scary movie it was however movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water not really worth watching would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80 but he also made very good slasher movie in the 70 the town the dreaded sundown &#39;,
 &#39; created in 1928 and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesn matter for six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey piloting steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and minnie mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and goat eats them mickey helps her crank it tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey peel potatoes mickey mouse was number 53 on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number 31 on the 100 greatest cartoons very good &#39;,
 &#39; tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford films at two hours it was quite long for 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in 1922 no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary &#39;,
 &#39; first realize that 1 rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out it not bad in self aware over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate it painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mock shock of what her name see don even remember her character name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh that right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didn notice him there hmmm br br it becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money you think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now there a novel idea br br my suggestion don see this film don rent the dvd don watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied &#39;,
 &#39; the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of g wells great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century 1900 â using wells original setting in and near woking england br br imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature so let get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no immunity if that a spoiler so be it after book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this ends br br this film which follows wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented â in way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th early 20th century photography although filmed in widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didn use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented good many changes in print quality even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on â as you ll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde of sort seen even as late as the 1920s â and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward â such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair br br this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells original narrative â as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells description of the martians â giant head mounted on numerous tentacles â is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england â plus few scenes in london involving the narrator brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of major landmark big ben but at least doesn dwell unduly on the devastation of london br br the victory of the martians is hardly surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters curate endowed with the victorian affliction of much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate â who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery british curates are so often utterly insufferable br br this film lasts almost 3 hours going through wells story in welcome detail it about time the author got his due â in compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact word about the acting don expect award winning performances they re not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman â also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by james lathrop in his first film br br this is overall splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors if you want to see g wells war of the worlds â and not some wholly distorted version of it â see this film &#39;,
 &#39; of the elements that make this the best at this point have to say 1 is christine mcintire shemp scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemp possibly dying br br another character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball hardly character would choose to meet in dark alley or for that matter anywhere would have preferred bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when short is this good who going to complain not &#39;,
 &#39; okay this is stupid they say their not making another nightmare film that this is the last one and what do they do they go on making another one not that the next one part7 was bad but why do they play us anyway this movie made no sense what so ever it was extremelly dull the characters were highly one dimensional freddy was another joker which is very stupid for such good series the plot is very very bad and this is even worse than part 2 and 5 didnt get the movie its stupid tale in 3 pointless id say hated this film so much still rmember all the parts didnt like which was basically the whole film this is so different than the prequels it tries and tries but this one tried the hardest and got slapped back on the face again there were hadly any death scenes although they were different they sucked bigtime how can they have gone this far didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5 yet they make this its all bout the money do not see this sad excuse for nightmare series br br gave nightmare on elm street six 6 3 out of 10 br br good points of movie had potential with plot br br bad points of film terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classified as horror very confusing &#39;,
 &#39; decided to watch this movie because d not seen carol lombard before in any movie m sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is dog â and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom were great actors br br the problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to story about young lawyer john manson played by stewart who marries jane played by lombard within an hour of meeting her what that clichã marry in haste repent at leisure br br in short the story is series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with john live in mother their struggles to pay the bills john diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples angst about their marriage the baby sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by lone pilot in fierce storm to bring special serum to save the child and finally john being accepted as junior partner at the law firm br br how many more clichã situations could the writers include maybe mother dying soon after there wasn much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear only the acting of the four main players was adequate br br this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn â during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie br br so it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun american values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative â all against the backdrop of the average american family who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard br br and it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939 so it was planned in 1938 â soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film was great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war as many here would know hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the war br br however m glad saw it â as piece of disguised socio political propaganda but ll have to see other lombard films to gain better appreciation of her acting range br br as another reviewer noted see this one just to say that you ve seen all of stewart movies otherwise don bother &#39;,
 &#39; br br must admit was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of cut last night though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem am true horror fan as true as they come and found cut to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced but one of the great parody comedy films of late br br my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in it application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could am certain this was intended as humour hoping this was intended as humour br br and of course there was the gore br br the use of the customised garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes in short there was huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth br br the appearance of both kylie minogue short that her appearance was and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as simon bossell the castle in brilliant role as the jokey technician br br all in all think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as beautiful satire parody toungue in cheek till the very end br br loved it go see it &#39;,
 &#39; like anyone else who bought this was duped by the 20 pieces of extreme gore and banned in 20 countries or whatever it says in the box have to admit am huge gore fan and am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business the revolutionized make up effects in the 80 today you don need them as everything is done on computer but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but digress br br watching fantastically gory films like fulci gates to hell or even savini crowning achievement friday the 13th the final chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making terrifically gory film you can tell the difference between reality and magic br br can imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money as many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath you don see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwords br br the gore well it here but not as much as one would hope or expect man does get castrated and women does get hanged by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving scalping there is nothing really much else to this film the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for maybe it just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but was expecting bit more call me sick or twisted but isn that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place honestly found myself bored in lot of places br br cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on craze of superior film while cannibal holocaust is not exactly great film it is much better than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for 20 00 you will feel cheated br br 3 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about movie where hit man and white bread salesman become buddies so few vagaries shouldn come as too much of surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan straight man ve read few negative comments in here about hope davis but thought she was quite good as mousy housewife with dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and few scenes where nearly died laughing my father consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hit man comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself &#39;,
 &#39; director don siegel really impressed me with this film it is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic well acted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer didn know what to expect sitting down to watch this civil war movie or some kind of 70 soft core peddling with eastwood descending on school for girls in the south but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized as one reviewer previously noted none none of the characters are likable by the film end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic eastwood plays cpl mcburney union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin you ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it girl at school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth hartman lovely young seductress carol and even ferdin amy have emotional sexual ties to eastwood each having their own needs and secrets and problems eastwood is not nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest the beguiled for me is masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front this might be except for invasion of the body snatchers siegel best film it certainly is one of eastwood best real performances page is always so very good and hartman fe5rdin et al excellent the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic some of the sexual laced scenes disturbing and what happens to eastwood is leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film &#39;,
 &#39; arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far about earthman flash gordon professor zarkov and beautiful dale arden traveling in rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbinding spectacular and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin prince thun and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura now she a car this serial is not just cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for 1936 the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate we get hawk men shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigrons oh my and many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and first rate special effects no way but for 1936 most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well written lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director frederick stephani does great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating worthy film for alex raymond phenom comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability don get me wrong this isn a shakespeare troupe by any means but buster crabbe does workmanlike likable job as flash he is ably aided by jean arden priscella lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later the shorts crabbe and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov frank shannon wears are about as form fitting pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is blonde bombshell lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton is class act jack tiny lipson plays king vultan boisterous rousing hilarious symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism lipson steals each and every scene he is in the plot meanders here there and everywhere but flash gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent &#39;,
 &#39; perfect movies are rare even my favorite films tend to have flaws rear window looks little stagey at times chris elliot character in groundhog day doesn work the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy the beginning of nights of cabiria is little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish br br the script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some miramax scores that are too manipulative every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile this truly is one of the best films have ever seen and wish there were more films like it br br am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film but am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems brilliant must see &#39;,
 &#39; regardless of what anyone says its b movie and the effects are poorly done if you re vampire fanatic suppose it would be ok not 10 out of 10 you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as movie not read it as book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story the story are good but it doesn carry the film no wonder it has low rating over all write this because chose to see this movie when saw some good reviews here on imdb but got severely disappointed don get me wrong thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters aren close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks might not have gotten so disappointed if had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you don care about acting or make up this is better as book 3 out of 10 for an ok story &#39;,
 &#39; just finished watching 2ftm the trailers intrigued me so much actually went to see it on opening weekend something never do needless to say was very disappointed the story has so much potential and it frustrating to see it get screwed up really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey first off am not mm hater thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off 3 4 times yes we all get it that he good looking guy with nice body but think most people knew this 10 years ago when he came on the scene in time to kill showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like sweaty madman 3 4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary think one time would have been sufficient it wouldn surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see movie about sports gambling unless enough about that let get into his role feel his acting was very forced and he didn seem very comfortable know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner but his lines were corny and cheesy it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines few times in short didn like his character even though was supposed to the accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales pitches his character was just too much of tool as brandon or jonathan pacino and assante were great but that no surprise piven is fun to watch as arie oooops mean jerry just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly it insulting that they could take great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it box office success 1 cool story that appeals to the male man 2 hunky hollywood actor for female women make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights 3 al pacino with 4 great speech scenes and 25 great one liners 3 every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan 4 jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school 4 throw in armand assante to seal the deal 5 plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessary br br this will be good enough for most people but not me anybody who disagrees with me ask your self this would this movie be much better if directed by sodeberg decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm br br will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding fake tear while embracing russo the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants big budget crapola &#39;,
 &#39; was watching the sci fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on while not as bad as wynorski curse of the komodo this still sucks bad wynorski uses the same island as in curse of the komodo as well as the same actors and house the effects are top notch suprising but thats about it don know what else to say about this movie oh yeah as in curse of the komodo the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island also when saw this part laughed hysterically komanbra part man komodo and cobra overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with movie steer clear to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating it almost over it almost over 0 out of 5 &#39;,
 &#39; only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest didn know how much would like it switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly he definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evie rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is great way to spend 2 hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable strongly disagree with &#39;,
 &#39; for greta garbo first talking picture mgm wisely chose eugene neill pultizer prize winning 1921 play anna christie br br also wisely the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast george marion as anna father chris and james mack as johnny the priest transmuted to johnny the harp for films so as not to offend br br this little change is interesting like too many films accused by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins of being little more than filmed stage plays the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn be more faithful to the property by diluting great cinematic stage work so it wouldn offend anyone or opening it up because they could too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place br br fortunately the respect the studio had for both neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion generally sensitive screen adaptation wonder of wonders marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo anna reveals her past on the farm to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact what the league of decency must have thought of that br br the source play greatest problem has always been that chris friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don always recognize br br the perfectly cast marie dressler who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood is the perfect balance for garbo anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only 90 minutes doesn allow us too much time to miss her one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from neill to bring dressler back for touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne second act appearance in show boat br br anna and marthy early scene together on screen 16 minutes into the film taking each other measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece not to be missed br br anna christie is great tragic play and good film drama it hard to imagine that latter day remake which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this 1930 remake it was first filmed without sound in 1923 also with george marion original broadway chris could improve on this excellent filming br br the internal scenes hew closest to the play but the exteriors shouldn be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards the backgrounds give better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set especially in the new york harbor br br nearly all garbo naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly only the too often parodied death scene from camille 7 years later will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies but this anna christie together with the variety of her 1932 films mata hari and grand hotel and the sublime lubitsch touch on her 1939 comedy ninotchka garbo laughs surely stand as her best br br neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded sea plays should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the s entered the conflict the long voyage home 1940 it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie and features youngish john wayne in one of his rare non westerns supporting fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way &#39;,
 &#39; this tv series was one of the ones loved when was kid even though see it now through the pink shaded glasses of nostalgia can still tell it was quality show very educational but still funny have not seen the original french version only the swedish have no idea how good the dubbing was it was too long ago to remember br br the premise of the show was to show you how the body works swear school still hasn taught me half of what know from this show it also tied in other things like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don exercise with nice examples within the body who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you the cartoon looked nice very kids friendly of course but done with care cells viruses electric signals in the brain antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures looking pretty much how you expect what they should look like in the animated body br br this and the series about history especially the environmentally scary finale were key parts of my childhood m so happy found them here &#39;,
 &#39; fans of the hbo series tales from the crypt are going to love this moh episode those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on will recognize this one right off the bat br br underrated indie favorite martin donovan also an excellent writer co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way he could play really nice if misunderstood guy next door or he can play the same role with creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness in the case of right to die he takes the latter approach and it definitely works br br donovan is doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist robin sydney much to the displeasure of his inconsolable unforgiving spouse abbey julia anderson when the two of them get involved in terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of making up and she horribly burned in fire he reluctant to pull the plug on her not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy corbin bernsen looking the worse for wear these days br br but abbey never been one to give up without fight and that where the ec theme of the episode comes in cuckolded husbands and wives have always been the genre favorite subject matter for some spooky and ooky supernatural shenanigans and this case is definitely no exception if anything the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere br br and that not to mention that john esposito original script does give the adultery angle just slight twist you don realize as you re watching that you only know half the story until close to the end think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas and you re there br br not bad effort but not the best of the lot either at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction especially in scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into truly horrifying experience indeed as with most moh episodes this one is following prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment so the extremely squeamish need not apply &#39;,

 &#39; that how burt reynolds describes this film which happens to be his best ever he plays tom sharky vice detective who on the trail of an international mobster vittorio gassman and the man he financing to be the next governor of georgia earl holliman in the novel by william diehl the story is more complex because the guy running for president this is very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story reynolds doesn do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films he very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for dope bust that goes wrong at times though the movie plays more like voyeuristic drama than crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster woman only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin sharky machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker julie london flora purim buddy de franco the manhattan transfer doc severinson sarah vaughan and joe williams al capps handles the score with magic this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever check it out br br score 8 out of 10 stars &#39;,

 &#39; they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once they re grown it easy to spot the writer director among the four he the quiet contemplative long haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only there no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still can figure out which one he is here a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like prison was apparently high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you don quite get the self important speeches or the slow motion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what you re supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah that the ticket why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world can wait to see it onscreen if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants &#39;,
 &#39; went to see this movie actually went to see family portraits which contains cutting moments 2 other short films by douglas buck at the mar del plata festival argentina just couldn watch it had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take peek every once in while by the time it was over my stomach was upside down and felt light headed just had to leave the cinema few minutes after the 2nd short begun btw of course was not the only one who left the room it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it just don get how you can love that kind of movies the shocking and bloody and horrible images saw got really stuck in my head for like two days also try to analyze the story my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it and just don think it makes any sense mean that amount of violence and stuff makes no other sense than to try to shock people and that not good enough reason think there absolutely nothing in this movie that can say well at least thing about it was good but well guess will never understand that kind of films &#39;,
 &#39; steven what have you done you have hit an all new low it is weird since steven last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway as for the action well let just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what shame wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time &#39;,
 &#39; this film can make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or don ever go in the water again fisherman nolan is out to nab killer whale very bad thing but when he accidentally accidentally mark you hits pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and use the word in all senses who is obviously sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself doubt it was her first when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychos br br the film reeks of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all it true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whale pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel little better br br the films final journey in which nolan follows the whale on bizarre journey to the north reminds me of melville eerie man whale connection and for moment hinted at truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident it clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss however it never goes there the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whale hugger tho he made good snap for her head little earlier love animals and detest whaling and what is more love orca whales but if this film goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming br br the only message one can walk away with is if you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you &#39;,

 &#39; uwe boll slips back in his film making skills once again to offer up scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on remote island an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked the mad scientist being investigated by reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way its as if he couldn be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life m guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had it really stinks clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he ever learned about film gets flushed the last film he made that was this bad was seed serial killer movie that is one of the worst films ve ever seen this isn that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this an almost so bad its good film d take pass unless it late at night and you re catching it on cable &#39;,
 &#39; this film is dreadful it has absolutely zero laughs hebrew hammer adam goldberg sets out to save hannukah from evil santa andy dick perhaps promising enough basis for plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise while there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring this despite the fact that goldberg dick and greer hammer client love interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite being played for what might be described as whacky over the top gags this film is consistently middle class middle of the road muck do not waste 85 minutes of your life on this note the music was good &#39;,
 &#39; am big fan of old horror movies and since am middle aged old to me is movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 to 1960 period am not big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow 1 which thought was great could reminisce about the stories there but really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was great ending all the stories were great though so why did like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with close up of face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was complete waste of time and turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it telling you something 4 of 10 also romero expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to pg standard don know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and that not good thing for movie with nothing else going on it shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it &#39;,

 &#39; emma is horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel have not read the book so really didn know that much about the plot and yet still predicted nearly the entire plot there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing the film is though for some reason very entertaining and loved it of course there were all the scenes disliked but the majority was well acted and funny gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here alan cumming who have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here and jeremy northam who performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle even if that was not what it needed there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching &#39;,
 &#39; thank god this wasn based on true story because what story it is populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds before the devil is mesmerizing jaw dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable and sometimes is even with or perhaps because of the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout if it weren carried out with such magnificent overwhelming conviction by its stars the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn hurt either br br the main dysfunction here is of family nature with the two majorly screwed up brothers brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke deciding to rob their own parents jewelry store an attempt that goes pathetically awry br br the story is told with time shifts which are noted on screen such as charlie two days before the robbery so no one should be confused some people have said they didn like this device but thought it worked perfectly adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks between them you couldn make decent poker hand to save your life throw in these cheesy extra tidbits one of the brothers is drug addict married to gina marisa tomei also excellent who is having an affair with the other brother toss in some monumental sibling rivalry along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father wrenching performance from albert finney who has apparently caused him serious past pain and you ve got shakespearean greek tragedy on your hands proceed with caution &#39;,

 &#39; this is great show with total freshness and innovation that usual chair couch for woman host that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes the same old jokes the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer probably the pattern of johnny carson copied by one and all latterman leno conan daly this show does not seem to have any of these br br fell in love with this show within the first 10 minutes and am going to stick to it though it too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest hope that this show will last long br br returning back after months still love this show and love his self deprecating humor for example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual monkeying of conan brien for example know it a cardinal sin to be repelled by brien antics but do really dislike his style and repetitiveness br br again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it ferensen spoof of trading spouses and nanny 911 in an earlier episode are hilarious idiot paparazzi are fun especially when security guard cautions them against taking people pictures and if am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting gary coleman br br added on 16th april 2007 coming back once again am left confused by the neighbor and her dog cannot decide if it is joke or real thing either way it was funny as hell br br do not expect spike feresten to read these pages but maybe he does he is crazier than bunch of monkeys and so would better write down my suggestion here for him would like him to do full 30 minute show with crazy gideon the star of late night tv commercial would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike talk show sing song and play guitar do skit in the line of snl and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles know crazy gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la br br god willing br br returning back on 14th july 2007 someone wrote here that the people who praised spike talkshow must be bribed by spike confess that spike really bribed me but must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night had sex with cindy crowford &#39;,
 &#39; now have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly m appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then m afraid don know what the world has come to let me tell something started watching many v shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos can honestly say that this is the only television series that have ever watched where have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesn excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony felt that it would ve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes knew that hbo had done great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2 and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have been so sucked into t show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic feel that the sopranos is one show that can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and challenge anyone to find real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral mean it is mafia show at the end of the day don think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god implore everyone to watch this show because believe me you ll be hooked from the very first episode was and have even gotten few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when say that this show is godsend compared to the crap that comes on v after you ve watched the first season you ll inevitably agree with me when once again say that this show dominates television and no v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos &#39;,
 &#39; d give this negative rating if could went into this movie not expecting much but had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are boob and guys johnson oh how original if were 12 year old boy might laugh at that have no idea how this movie became so popular seriously the worst thing ve ever seen wasn entertained it wasn funny wasn even bored wasn anything it wasn even so bad it was good it just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie don even rent this movie no clue how it getting such high rating &#39;,
 &#39; this is great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was can remember being freaked out by metal teens when was kid it doesn help that found desecrated grave in my hometown graveyard when was ten turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but love it now as 24 year old br br bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you gotta love scene where guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd this movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this one for you 9 10 &#39;,
 &#39; while not quite as good as murder is announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation and you know what it is huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version now don take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either poor script confusing final solution or both the geraldine mcewan version suffered from plodding pace and both of the above problems and would consider second worst of the itv adaptations worst being sittaford mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing this adaptation of the book nemesis is huge improvement it not only respects the book despite few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of decent book it is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent the performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general well done script with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple and solid turns from liz fraser helen cherry joanna hole and anna cropper margaret tyzack is outstanding though in chilling and moving performance as clothilde overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments 9 10 bethany cox &#39;,
 &#39; had heard and read so many good things about weeds that was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like entourage sopranos or mad men but that slowly eroded away with each episode watched from season one didn make it past the first six episodes br br the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip it was rare moment when actually emitted an audible laugh br br the characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing absolutely hated the addition of the brother in law who should have been hauled away on to catch predator and the removal of the hodes daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clichã had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer loyalty br br episode after episode liked the characters less and couldn get past many of the technical flaws in the story line br br add to that heard that season two wasn as good so lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out br br if you re fan of good casting and writing suspect this show will be challenge for you to like unless of course you re stoned and then all bets are off &#39;,
 &#39; saw zp when it was first released and found it major disappointment its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey 60s it politics too upfront and ridiculous and let face it was still under love spell known as blowup and still haven completely shaken it now the love is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and oh well good luck to me br br but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been teacher to me revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age and zp is it own experience and is only really linked to blowup through its creator the late great mr antonioni br br twelve years ago had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print projected at its correct size immense restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such thing of beauty in good shape to this day remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared it was like thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to new level of awareness and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of place br br what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own br br remember the second time around seeing it the early 80s had begun to feel affection towards the film as whole and towards daria and mark in particular whereas before these two seemed like smart alecky shadow version of zefferelli olivia and leonard read romeo and juliet they now were engaging me particularly the girl in her insistent slo motion ality she took her time to live everything everything dies around her br br upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found enjoyment the encroaching shoulder padded big haired 80s whispered but that a hippie fantasy let it go br br the force of antonioni vision had had realised already worked itself inside of me the first time around so answered 80s with an uh huh and guarded my love secretly possessively and jealously br br but this then is what good art does it lives inside of you and if you wish it has its way and loves you back secretly jealously and possessively and you get changed br br was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup undoubtedly zp must be seen on gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment but hey sometimes even glimpse of the beloved in newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all br br today reality hit zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice restaurant br br so it is still too difficult too disturbing too what br br maybe it that as with all good art it lives while everything dies around it br br peace &#39;,
 &#39; this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70 starring jan michael vincent as young man who doesn make the cut as marine dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing vincent stops at bar and runs into very young richard gere who has just returned from tour in the pacific as hard core marine raider gere character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of vincent innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway vincent character whose name is marion takes gere outfit and is suddenly transformed into marine raider marion hitch hikes his way into wyoming and stops at little norman rockwell like little town in the local cafã he meets rose hudkins who immediately catches his eye staying with hudkins parents marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how marine raider could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese internment camps as the towns folks go hunting 3 escapees marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but there still happy ending which befuddled me bit would have preferred little more drama anyway this captures jmv at the peak of his 70 performances buster and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid 70 were amazingly good jmv performances he was both an action star and heart throb all at the same time he made lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80 with the great tv show airwolf he does very good job in this as hedge quietly observing the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country he must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like he the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with jmv talent and his looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and billie is much more dramatic anyway glynnis connor is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like norman rockwell painting the outdoor scenes are gorgeous must have been filmed in canada &#39;,
 &#39; johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is traditional rendering of the gospel stories the music is great you get real feel of what the world of jesus looked like ve been there too and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with passion cash narration is good too br br but br br 1 the actor who played jesus was miscast 2 there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music 3 because it is uncompelling doubt we ll see this ever widely distributed again br br d love to buy the cd br br tom paine texas usa &#39;,

 &#39; mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna erika fay lives her best friend is rosie martine hughes she has mexican boyfriend named miguel gabriel gutierrez who are determined to track beast down that has been terrorising the town killing livestock several residents including some of their friends local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra an evil creature from myth legend erm m struggling now because not that much else actually happens br br written directed by scott maginnis won beat about the bush here simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful period the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once the rest of the time it referred to chupacabra in fact suspect this wasn really conceived as werewolf flick at all the werewolf creature looks mostly hairless more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon it actually attacks during the day on couple of occasions there is no transformation scene at the end when it is killed it doesn change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title there nothing here to indicate werewolf film at all even then the title is just rip off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london 1981 this is the type of home made crap that personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead 1978 the evil dead 1981 halloween 1978 or friday the 13th 1980 which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe the blair witch project 1999 but that it in recent years crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered classic the character are awful things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks virtually sent me to sleep as whole this film is just crap m sorry but don know how else to describe it br br director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable there the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone headache quick blink you ll miss something editing which just annoys irritates in equal measure it not scary there no nudity there no tension or atmosphere the special effects are awful the monster really does look poor it no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get good look at it there virtually no colour to the picture either it either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well the gore consists of some fake guts blink you ll miss them few bloody wounds severed arm big deal br br with supposed budget of about 300 000 admit the budget was low but simply refuse to accept that for making such rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far the whole thing has the look of home movie it has no style is throughly bland dull to look at the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that br br mexican werewolf in texas will probably con few people into renting buying watching it because they might mistakenly think it a sequel to john landis classic which it most certainly isn it isn even proper werewolf flick either don be fooled this is awful m fed up of having to waste time money on home made amateur crap like this &#39;,
 &#39; found this to be surprisingly light handed touch at 1950 culture clash movie john wayne would hardly be one first choice as cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as bull run in harrods but this time he was left to play part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style the duke was guy who really could act well his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle br br despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie many of his good intentions came cropper he had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian br br the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell for leather battles cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well there was great deal of minutely choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props the set pieces were complex and detailed lot of money and thought had been applied to it br br the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just political or flag waving effort script was good without being too wordy there was great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didn interfere with the narrative it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set whether or not they were japanese couldn say but anyway they looked the part at least the leads were not played by cross dressing caucasians unlike other efforts such as blood alley yes know they were chinese the inn of the sixth happiness or even the king and br br frankly enjoyed this more than any of those other movies the script was better for start never liked the songs in the king and and wasn impressed by the heavy laden anti communist subtext of blood alley confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke more popular outings br br recommended &#39;,
 &#39; truly appalling waste of space me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end and can count the films have switched off before the end on one hand br br the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring wouldn be surprised if they found the script in pile of cast off scripts from 1983 for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone mean seriously the police would be beating his door down in minutes the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in river it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flicks between characters in seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters oh and what characters they are the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful he could have just sent cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed after 60 or so minutes of the film had built absolutely zero attachment to this character he is neither sympathetic nor hateful just disfigured dummy from shop window blundering through every single scene his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery is he happy is he sad angry no idea just those same dead eyes staring out at you from disfigured chunk of flesh and the native american theme is just awful and pointless br br the good guys are at best unlikeable dull white collar stereotype and simpering neurotic ex wife stereotype cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you aren going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying br br the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated br br roasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke or worse she is just floozy who sleeps with anything that moves realistic female characters ftw br br in summary complete mess of film hopeless characterisations and performances leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull its not even comedy bad either laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film &#39;,
 &#39; one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as mad scientist flick from the early 50 there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic br br there has been great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichã sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever br br however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears think we can thank verhoeven for that &#39;,
 &#39; ok so it owes pulp fiction but in my opinion has it own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style sketch like narrative and great performances thomas jane delivers great the drug dealer show down is extraordinary aaron eckhart likewise james legros has short and effervescent appearance great humor they got the wong house the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable as is mickey rourke cameo appearance take peak br br great hollywood popcorn production with strong performances of level aspirants and renegades rourke br br well take peak it worth &#39;,
 &#39; as far as know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal d agree with him this is fantastic film about quite gifted boy man with special body part helping him oscar and bafta winning and golden globe nominated daniel day lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor in wheelchair and carried by his family he has special left foot though he can write with it paint with it and hold things with it he learns to speak later in the film it is very good for guy like him also starring home alone 2 oscar winning and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr brown it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan best writing screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture it was nominated the baftas for best film best make up artist and best adapted screenplay daniel day lewis was number 85 on the 100 greatest movie stars he was number 20 on the 50 greatest british actors he was number 9 on britain finest actors and he was number 15 on the world greatest actor and the film was number 28 on the 50 greatest british films outstanding &#39;,
 &#39; this film was very well advertised am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then went and saw it was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until remembered that had paid for this movie made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood was in plus wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie always go into movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie ve ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead &#39;,
 &#39; as far as know this was my first experience with icelandic movies it such relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have small chance of succeeding in the big world can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or other br br because it really worth while left the cinema feeling really sad couldn get the tragic destiny of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when thought of the complexity of the film not only was it tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and very good soundtrack br br if you have the opportunity watch it it really thought provoking and made me ponder lot br br &#39;,
 &#39; director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces like network dog day afternoon or serpico but he was not having too much luck on his most recent works gloria 1999 was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment now lumet brings his best film in decades and by my point of view true masterpiece before the devil knows you re dead think this film is like rebirth for lumet this movie has an excellent story which deeply has many layers also think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant philip seymour hoffman brings as usual magnificent performance and he no doubt one of the best actors of our days ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he underrated by my point of view his performance in here is great the rest of the cast is also excellent specially the great albert finney but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars the film has good level of intensity in part thanks to the performances and in part thanks to the brilliant screenplay before the devil knows you re dead is real masterpiece with perfect direction great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movies like this &#39;,
 &#39; first of all should point out that really enjoyed watching this documentary not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful however all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist east meets west clichã that bothers many turks like myself okay this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in very stylish manner which is good thing something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds however the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as east from the eyes of the west mean like one jazz musician says in the film maybe there is no east and west maybe it is just myth lie created by the ruling leaders of western countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and keep the cash flowing br br why don you think about that &#39;,
 &#39; first off have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget sci fi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was mindless hour and half the cg was not as bad as was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years sounds like good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and very small actual war between dragons rather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thing along with all 5 of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest ve seen lot of movies like reptilian the cave spider and others but have to say if you want non stop laugh for an hour watch this br br story 1 10 cg 5 10 acting 3 10 br br don drink but it would have helped before watching this movie &#39;,
 &#39; thank god watched this at friend place and did not pay for it the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of tv show if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics watch out you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence br br also actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting have ever seen excluding porn she lucky that matt lanter is actually decent he the one that carries the movie br br hate that wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie it a shame that they got to call it sequel because was fan of the original which was actually pretty good &#39;,
 &#39; friend lent me this dvd which he got from the director at festival think went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great so maybe that colored my judgment but have to admit that liked this movie br br the standouts where the actors youssef kerkor was really good as ernie the main character kind of pathetic in likable way adam jones who also directed and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad the bill character justin lane who spends lot of the film dressed like panda was by far my favorite he seemed the least one dimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much called the guy after watching the dvd really kind of lovable and very funny some of the other acting was good some was so so but none of it was bad also really liked the vigilante duo ridiculous and funny br br m giving this one high marks even though it has some issues because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared and decided to make their movie their way well done to adam jones and crew &#39;,

 &#39; really cant think of anything good to say about this film not single thing the script is nightmare the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference you think they would at least get technical advisor the performances were bad by most of the cast although dont really blame them the material really stinks the editing was equally bad ll just stop now its all bad 2 10 &#39;,
 &#39; cinema greatest period started in post war europe with italy neo realist movement during the next 2 or 3 decades that followed france new wavers caught everyone attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in 1971 luchino visconti brought the art form to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like grand summing up not just of visconti particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner task master than the visconti revealed here he not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in sturm und drang cosmos br br we will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the century great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahler 5th symphony taking full advantage of mahler ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into decrepit composer from his original persona as writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair duck like walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies it a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in gesture or glance difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse br br cinema just doesn get better than this ll ignore the complaints from the ritalin addicts out there who say that it too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie thematic concerns e which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what it mostly about is suffering romantic capital suffering in particular as suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spoke br br spoiler guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogarde jet black hair dye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalk white face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogarde dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is miraculous work of art br br dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie it ostensibly in english but the dvd sound seems muddy and there a lot of italian spoken during the film anyway br br &#39;,
 &#39; this show is great for many reasons the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age its so great to see real family instead of some stuffy overacting family watched this one time and became hooked it so great to see black family on tv worth watching this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy sexy drugs bad dates death etc the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in real humorous sort of way great show for the family cant tell you how many times have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off great pg 13 rated show loved everybit of this show &#39;,
 &#39; this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though will concede that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by competent director as it turned out this was not to be the case br br apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointing br br true it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in batman weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfying br br michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partner in crime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities br br there are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness can really point out is certain limpness to the script in some places which think is due mostly to the way this film is four cornered fight there simply isn enough time to properly explore what going on br br nevertheless this is damn good film highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton &#39;,
 &#39; the quick and the undead is finally the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void it is essentially one gigantic plot hole br br aside from that the acting was quite bad character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn a single character worth hanging our hat on the most interesting cast member who had great potential to be dark horse protagonist got snuffed halfway through the proceedings br br what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color timing it looked excellent when you take into account budget considerations br br unfortunately it plays out like guy got his hands on hundred grand and watched few westerns most notably the good the bad and the ugly and then just threw bunch of elements haphazardly into movie you know they have movies where characters do this does it fit here no but who cares they do it in other movies so should do it here br br maybe good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists first year film schoolers otherwise must miss &#39;,
 &#39; was stunned by this film afterwards didn even want to see any films for long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison br br for many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering hero stream of consciousness so it doesn produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema br br but for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things br br &#39;,
 &#39; this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film ve seen in full the first was rope which really enjoyed with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas rope took place all in one room didn enjoy this one as much as rope but that not saying this is bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more br br it seems like film hitchcock would make as break in between his more serious ones as thriller feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside br br the film doesn feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving br br the performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down pat br br in the end wanted more from this one understand it one of hitchcock least exciting films but did have good time watching it can recommend it just not enthusiastically &#39;,
 &#39; it is always difficult to bring 450 pages book down to three hours film read the book before and found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible the qualities of the book haven been lost the dense and lively depiction of fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue point of view then from maud one the main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with first culmination in very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each other br br for each of her books the author sarah waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show high grade of historic truth highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of my all time favorite cheap corny vampire movies br br calvin klein underwear model oh mean stefan the good vampire returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty but manicure impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans having killed their father the vampire king radu now sets his sights on stefan stefan new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends and the all powerful bloodstone br br okay the scenery is beautiful and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl fricken vania for gosh sakes the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as refrigerated fireplace poker but who cares there only one reason to watch this movie and his name is radu he a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie all spoken in the raspy voice of man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes day the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning slobbering face for the world to see found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother but maybe m just sicko questionable taste in men aside highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts it original it fun and radu is one of the best vampires ve seen in long time much more fun than the stiff tragic whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes he what vampire should be &#39;,
 &#39; get smart should be titled get stupid there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye as for anne hathaway what is she doing in this film she a good actress but is just plain terrible br br the writing is pathetically lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gag br br the directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and isn is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing ve ever seen br br 0 stars &#39;,
 &#39; this was by far the worst movie ve ever seen and thats compared to alexander fortress 2 and the new world br br should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was truly traumatic experience for the first ten minutes was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen didn think it was possible to make such bad film in this day and age was wrong while typing this message ve thought of good reason to buy this movie joke present at xmas m blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it thanks babe br br be warned true shocker all round &#39;,
 &#39; if you ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much as did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand fundamental element of vonngut writing that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself and that you can put human mind on the screen his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by screenplay or even the best acting performance believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen does this mean that the movie misses the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not medium for those too lazy to turn page it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of story created by one of america true artistic treasures and presents it in a framework without pretense ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut genius and loses grip on his own craft would not place this movie as one of the best ve seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching by taking vonnegut voice out of the movie narration or trying to insert it however it can mother night tells his story brilliantly and preserves the story fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of the worst movies ve ever seen not only that it is comedy which isn funny but it also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects br br the two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite lot that they touched each others genitals all the time but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle but hadn expect anything better by director michael bully herbig who also made two not funny tv shows not funny western movie and nearly not funny sf comedy movie but erkan and stefan had been just little better in some of their stand up programs for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel who is very beautiful to me &#39;,
 &#39; sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time but dear gussie whoever thought this script was worth producing the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad with constantly illogical sequence of scenes an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face looks like bad movie from the 40 &#39;,
 &#39; the only conceivable flaw of this film is it title please stop comparing it to the first did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you haven seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent different name for this there is nothing alike and has mood all its own this is great exponent of screwy mid 80s comedy seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom 100 is because of its title usually hate movies like these e adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically dunno maybe it like bad relationship can get out of or just ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind the stunt man br br robert stack we love you 1919 2003 &#39;,

 &#39; wonderful film ahead of its time br br think so in the eighty it was all about winning greed is good remember that one have seen this film more that 20 times to me this is real desert island film keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that just love jessica tandy and hume cronin are simply wonderful also beverly angelo beau bridges come in at close second don get me wrong there are many more great performance in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and hope you film that you will want to see over and over think tv shows like northen exposure and now earl owe lot to this film but remember it is not tom cruise film &#39;,
 &#39; yes this is one of those movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and laughed at this movie the other comments give the idea well enough the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses br br but the rat yes the big rat why we didn get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me often the big one isn shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money surmise however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was guy running around dressed up like woodchuck with third world dentistry br br the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene after figuring out that the rats couldn stand loud noise migraines from the bad acting the main dude rigs up fire alarm to send the rats into frenzy if you ve ever wanting to see pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like geyser this film is for you really you need to rent it and see for yourself br br but not for more than 99â ok &#39;,
 &#39; shallow grave begins with either tribute or rip off of the shower scene in psycho m leaning toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the south br br group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by flat tire after getting off the main road note to yankees stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness murder but you may run across marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being good br br while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes creepy facsimile of normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic southern deputy as ve seen since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of 1000 corpses br br few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at bbq in south carolina and display their racism when big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into barn to hide behind some hay bales and in shockingly realistic moment large snake is hiding in the hay with her br br and in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like he about to rape patty carol cadby and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ feel sorry for this preacher flock jezebel was in the old testament few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven &#39;,

 &#39; after many many years saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would half century after react to film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when was just an male adolescent trying to understand women behaviors in small city in brazil br br this time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr han suyin jennifer jones makes clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition as an eurasian in fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her chinese side its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at minimum failure in her attempts to control them br br therefore suyin attitudes always leave poor elliott â determined brave and extremely practical man â anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words for him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make couple and begin immediately life together not so fast is what she seems verbally and non verbally to answer him all the time br br in fact suyin chinese portion would never allow her such level of pragmatism and as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of japanese invasion but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beings br br in fact it looks like whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people life totally miserable because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon peasants are advised that they should shout loudly the rice is bad the rice is bad to protect their crops from being stolen by deities and in funeral it is recommended that the dead family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods don take advantage of their sorrow and fragility br br in other words suyin introduces us to culture in which the supernatural has real existence as if rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone daily life br br as the story takes place in hong kong in 1949 it should be clear that china really was at that time almost semi feudal society while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the usa after the first oil shock in 1973 took charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both sides of suyin eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today br br lot of history came into being since those old days as to china the main fact is that after several phases of communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism and what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong in 1949 and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it is gone completely gone in brief if that story took place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual &#39;,
 &#39; first and foremost would like to say that before watched this film considered myself an accepting individual someone that cared about others appreciated others found no barely any judgment against other people and this film has think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically when watched it didn know particularly what it was about knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that was clueless and as began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time watched it was blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness as human beings to their relationship watched it second time because finally figured out how hypocritical was being saying to myself and others oh accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear suppose the second time watched this film opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that d heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love and loved it loved the storyline loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film loved the sharing of feelings and loved the strong bonds created it is really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in &#39;,

 &#39; m stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as high rating as they did it an innocuous sweet uncomplicated clichã of film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels like good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and were watching this and before we saw the rating we said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences it possible to make good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone it miles ahead of this schlock &#39;,
 &#39; after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi yet think that man to man in its own right is as good show on the good episodes as darkplace cant argue that 2 of the episodes really are nt that good but the other 4 certainly make up for it if had to pick 2 great episodes id go for formula4 driver steve pising pronounced pissing and the great garth marengi to already have bit of understanding of the programme is real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie his argument with def lepord over their name all in all great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes &#39;,
 &#39; caught this on television one day when was young and loved it in the 1970 there were bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was nice surprise it one of the best comedies of the 1970 and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as director reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time while this film is hilarious and meatballs 2 is so bad that it fun meatballs 3 and meatballs 4 are absolutely dreadful recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters &#39;,
 &#39; can even describe it it the worst movie ve ever seen m being nice guy when call it movie just another big budget made to someone who doesn like to think much it not even scary it revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this thing to trick movie fans guess big producers make whatever they want br br just get big producer hot chicks allthough horrible actresses and ton of horror movie clichã and cook it for week or so and you ll get the nun br br and thought bad boys 2 was horrible &#39;,
 &#39; the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience doesn know what the story is had no problem with the low production values and the acting wasn great but this is telly so it was fine don mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such non sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash avoid this at all costs br br the prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed voice over to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it wasn clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to some riots are happening in petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them know the basic history of the revolution so could fill in the details those pesky communists the prologue is best ignored br br this could have been thoughtful study of person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence it sets up melodramatic romance love so strong it ll believe anything she says okay soppy romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures this also doesn work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story collapses despite there being plenty of love scenes was never convinced of the reason that they were in love find rom com romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they ve even spent any time with each other br br it could have been thriller type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of better film br br the funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either there a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as one flew over the cuckoo next twelve monkeys type informant thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story &#39;,

 &#39; wow what this on the video rental store shelf in front of me nothing other than questionable sequel to 8mm it wasn a very good sequel to movie that had very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie br br basically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fiancã tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with porno video taken of them with prostitute risa the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancã which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end br br didn like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene otherwise its totally different movie it made for lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of possibility because didn believe the words coming out of david mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was liar about most things that might get him in trouble br br there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery counted at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative br br david was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress tish father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like bondage queen and gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs too because it wasn even about last breath nobody really dies but they did have good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere but that was good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3 4 long movie br br go rent and maybe buy the original it one of joel schumacher better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film wouldn recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges &#39;,
 &#39; ok honestly dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie 1 jack performance he was very good can tip my hat for him 2 danny performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off 3 10 &#39;,

 &#39; had it with the one who raised you since when you were young you just want her gone from your life that woman is your mother you should respect her you should honor her whether she in sick or well but that in times it can be aggravating especially when she becomes very overbearing that how owen danny devito had to deal with in throw momma fron the train his momma anne ramsey 1929 88 is one of the worst he trying his best to be writer and she is everything but grateful calls him clumsy poop larda and fat and stupid for his friend larry donner billy crystal he has his own woman problems his ex wife she trying to discredit him so what did owen do push her overboard what does he do help return the favor get rid of mrs lift in the kitchen scene liked it where owen called larry cousin patty and momma said you don have cousin patty and owen shouts you lied to me and el cabongs larry with the frying pan then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift that is thwarted and she kicks larry off the train well everything back to normal the ex wife lives but momma kicked the bucket on her own maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways fun movie it is and the cast is great classic 5 stars &#39;,
 &#39; have to agree that this movie and it talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve here hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of wider audience the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent perhaps overall the movie is little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary good for the actors am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors &#39;,
 &#39; laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have good laugh &#39;,
 &#39; never want to see this movie again br br not only is it dreadfully bad but can stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick br br mostly can stand watching this terrible movie br br frankly there is no reason to watch this awful film the plot is just plain stupid the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films br br warn you don watch it the images will haunt you for long while to come &#39;,
 &#39; life begins and ends in typical 1930 maternity recovery ward where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us look back in time to see what giving birth in typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great grandmothers found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving br br oddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton grace loretta young husband what an actor as first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off cafeteria table felt his every concern keenly d like to see more of this actor work he had very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed don cut don cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show more humane side of the medical profession br br loretta young did another superb acting job here as well very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months br br glenda farrell played her role of shrill unwed mother little over the top for my taste didn anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the end br br also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notable br br life begins is must see precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring few hankies to cry into 9 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; possible spoilers perhaps must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disney sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were disservices to their original film classics disney also made the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that am an avid supporter of good disney films and absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like m going to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as have affectionately named her says ewww that is the anti cinderella try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsisters is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesn seem so if remember correctly anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia was evil in the second one she is good one just can leave story like this hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming walt disney name perhaps now that michael eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the house of mouse &#39;,
 &#39; hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8 this movie true score br br as mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie wasn that over the top about him but now m banging on the doors of chris rock website begging him to take me on as his protege this film is truly funny if you don find this movie funny you really need therapy and it humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes on br br there was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film didn realise that it was actually remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty as such was quite surprised when watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie had watched on tv few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any you get the picture br br well to the actual plot of the film br br don spoil the experience for yourself don read the plot just go and watch movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in long time go and see it because it a cinema experience that doesn leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is good movie &#39;,
 &#39; formula movie about the illegitimate son of rich chilenian who stands to inherit fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like tv movie not really exciting the only reason bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell part is very small and doesn add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare &#39;,
 &#39; whatever rating give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesn stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money br br whatever it amounts to hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be visitor from another film when he finally appears br br it so campy that among taylor fans it probably considered must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without drink in your hand you re way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it bomb judge for yourself if you dare &#39;,

 &#39; this film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that it hard to imagine that we ll see worse movie this year or in the following years love brother set in australia among italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichã about italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film the message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like suburbia or lost in translation but here his pseudo italian accent is hard to bear see this film at your own risk trash as trash can &#39;,

 &#39; based on the best selling novel the dismissal the missing star the latest film by acclaimed italian director gianni amelio is the story of the growing friendship between an older italian maintenance man and young interpreter he hires in shanghai to be his guide through china vincenzo buonovolonta is the maintenance manager at steel mill in italy that has been shut down and the blast furnace sold to china when vincenzo sergio castellitto discovers that control unit in the furnace is defective and potentially dangerous he travels to china to find the steel mill where the part has been sold in hopes of preventing fatal accident br br the film of course is about the journey not the destination to use familiar clichã and on that journey we are privy to an engaging look at china with all its immense beauty and complexity via the outstanding cinematography by luca bigazzi the film takes us to shanghai wuhan chongquing baotou and trip along the yangstze river showing us coastal areas that are scheduled to be flooded when the three gorges dam is fully operative chinese mega project that has resulted in the displacement of 1 2 million people the trip brings the travelers face to face with poverty overcrowded housing and children left to fend for themselves br br the film revolves around the relationship between vincenzo and translator liu hua tai ling who first meet in italy where his impatience with her translations at dinner meeting causes her to lose her job when he tracks her down in shanghai she is working at library and resistant to vincenzo approach looking at his offer to help him in his travels in china as little more than well paying job she reluctantly agrees to accompany him their relationship however grows as they move from city to city her interpretive skills much in evidence to help the bewildered vincenzo who does not own cell phone br br as they slowly open up to each other they expose each other vulnerability and the film delves into their past and present life and how they arrived at their present situation we meet liu son lin wang at the home of her grandmother in china one child policy he is one of the unwanted children who have been hidden since the father of the boy abandoned the family although the meeting between vincenzo and the boy is casual their relationship becomes central to how the story plays out br br castellitto is an excellent actor though one longs for younger enrico lo verso in this role however he is emotionally distant throughout the film his expression rarely changing from far away hangdog expression though tai ling brings great deal of presence to the role her relationship with the much older vincenzo never seemed real to me and the ending seemed to exist only in reality known as the movies though amelio is one of my favorite directors coming on the heels of the brilliant keys to the house missing star is disappointment &#39;,
 &#39; this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt &#39;,
 &#39; jackass number two is easily the most hilarious film of 2006 beating the also hilarious clerks ii it is one of the best sequels in recent memory beating jackass the movie in every way now this film may be the funniest but it is also the most offensive appalling and utterly disgusting you will find yourself feeling sick several times throughout the film m completely serious when say don eat anything before watching or during this film because chances are that it will literally come back to haunt you keep the drinking to minimum as well you ve been warned because just like the tagline says it will make you beg for mercy br br jackass number two follows the crazy men from the hit show jackass johnny knoxville bam margera ryan dunn steve chris party boy pontius preston lacy ehren mcghehey dave england brandon dicamillo and jason wee man acuna chris raab himself raab is absent as they perform the most outrageous life threatening and revolting stunts imaginable m not going to tell what the stunts are but will warn you that any scene with an animal will be sickening or psychologically frightening and that one cast member once again not telling will flirt with death several times in the film br br what makes jackass number two so entertaining is not the stunts themselves but how the cast reacts to them and to doing them to put it simple if they loved doing it and had blast you will too this goes for 99 of the stunts all the stunts are very original and 90 of them are never before seen you will witness few recycled ones but they re amped up you wouldn think directing really factors into movie like this but it does jeff tremaine direction makes the movie so much funnier because he provides guidance for the gang in their comedic timing which is simply brilliant on his part he could have just sat back and slept throughout filming actually you ll see in the film that he did sleep through some filming but he went out there and helped these crazy guys make the stunts as funny as he could give mr tremaine two thumbs up for that another great thing about jackass is its bonanza of celebrity cameos and this time they include bmx legend mat hoffman skateboard god tony hawk director actor jay chandrasekhar super troopers beerfest actor luke wilson miami dolphins star jason taylor and director actor mike judge office space the scenes with hoffman taylor and chandrasekhar are among the funniest in the film as it even funnier to see these men as part of the film br br jackass number two is one of the most politically incorrect morally degrading and just plain wrong movies of all time if not the most despite this it is so original and so hilarious that you won care about that you ll be gasping for air laughing so hard you ll be crying and jumping out of your seat laughing throughout the entire film due to the explicit and potentially disturbing graphic content of this film no one under 18 should watch this film you ve been warned hope you enjoy jackass number two as much as did br br 10 10 spy &#39;,
 &#39; remember the events of this movie the ill fated cruise of donald crowhurst in 1968 in the golden globe single handed around the world yacht race was 13 year old living in england the previous year francis chichester later sir francis he was knighted for his exploits had completed the first solo circumnavigation of the globe remember it mostly because we were given time off school to watch his return on grainy black and white tv and then his knighting by the queen it provoked huge outpouring of patriotic fervor in the uk it all seems so quaint now chichester became national hero but he had stopped half way in australia to re fit his yacht so the next logical step for yachtsmen was to attempt the journey without stopping br br it important to remember that this was world pre gps when communications on land were still pretty erratic never mind in the middle of the ocean now with gps receivers that fit on key chain and calculate position within metre anywhere on earth it hard to recall time when you could go to sea and quite literally vanish as donald crowhurst did br br number of yachtsmen signed up all men back then including mystery man crowhurst essentially weekend sailor crowhurst had not been spectacular success in any previous enterprise including careers in the british army the air force and as an electronics entrepreneur selling navigation aids he wanted to do something big with his life and he saw the five thousand pound first prize well over 100 000 in today money and the ensuing publicity as means of kick starting his business he signed deal with sponsor that proved more watertight than his boat and which meant failure would bankrupt him and soon found himself popular figure with journalists as he prepared for the race now the brits always love the idea of the gutsy amateur taking on the pros think eddie the eagle losing endless olympic ski jump competitions and the amateur riders who regularly start the grand national horse race the public queued up to see him set off but his boat wasn really ready and even as he started the last competitor to leave the uk crowhurst must have known he didn seriously have chance but too much was riding on him to quit br br in the wonderful archive footage we see doubt written all over his poor wife face left behind with their 4 children she is interviewed movingly throughout the film together with one of crowhurst sons she was in no win situation had she attempted to stop him she would have been considered spoiler but afterward she was riven with doubt as to whether she could have saved his life by stopping him faced with the certain truth that his boat was leaking and would never make it through the southern oceans and unable to turn around and face ridicule bankruptcy and ignominy crowhurst devised plan to cheat laid up offshore argentina and brazil out of radio contact he waited for the leaders to round cape horn and start back up the atlantic thinking he could sneak in at the end of the line and pretend he had sailed all the way around the globe he elaborately falsified his logs and made 16mm films and audio recordings to back up his plan but as one after another the other competitors dropped out he realized that in fact he would come in 2nd and his logs would be scrutinized unable to face certain detection his journal suggests he lost his grip on reality and eventually committed suicide his yacht was found he never was br br this beautifully edited film also follows the journey of bernard moitessier an experienced and enigmatic french sailor who was in second place and certain of the fastest journey prize when he abruptly left the race unable to deal with the clamour and publicity he knew he would face and sailed into the wide blue yonder eventually pulling up some 10 months later in tahiti having spent some seven years working at sea myself albeit on very different ships to these well understand the pull of the ocean standing on deck seeing water in every direction to the horizon knowing there a couple of miles of water below you nothing between you and oblivion but thin metal hull without easy access to tv or radio even nowadays on most working ships you feel pretty isolated it possible to truly escape from the responsibilities of everyday life for while there is some thoughtful analysis of what drives people to attempt this kind of very long lonely journey and the effect it has on the human mind most people would think that attempting to raise 4 children is adventure enough but much is made of the need for self discovery in the hardships at sea the search for self br br strongly suspect that robin knox johnston the ex navy guy who won the race and many since probably knew pretty well who he was before he set off which was why he succeeded not just in winning the race but also retaining his sanity en route those who went searching for something profound within themselves may not have entirely liked what they found br br the marvelous archive footage of britain in the late 60s is almost reason enough to watch this did it really look quite that bad don remember it looking quite so dowdy but perhaps we blot out the worst aspects of the past but overall it is an excellently well made and engrossing movie highly recommended &#39;,

 &#39; jim carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today with his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy and we love him for it he has the ability to make mediocre comedies ala ace ventura and turn them into decent comedic outings or in the case of liar liar make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas he was excellent in both man on the moon and the truman show the guy is remarkable br br then comes bruce almighty an ideal vehicle for carrey and premise that should have worked carrey after complaining about god and how his life stinks is enabled with god powers however the script is pure recycled garbage now no matter how bad script is carrey improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny the problem is that there are very few opportunities for carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects only some of which are amusing carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects the writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving carrey nothing else to work with besides whiny character who is absolutely humorless he seems more like 5 year yearning for our attention wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny when it really just annoying br br have always enjoyed jennifer aniston on friends and she was superb in last year the good girl she too has gift for comedy but with the script as linear as it is she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend she comes across as nagging grumpy and there is no chemistry between the two stars br br bruce almighty should have been comedy that works but it doesn even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it making fun of religion few minor giggles his internet is yehweh but instead it just turned into comedic superpower comedy not to mention that it tone shifts from silly to heavy handed and even black comedy at times the movie fails on nearly every level that not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs but it close any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of dog peeing to get it laughs has problems but hey if you find pee jokes funny go for it br br &#39;,
 &#39; shameless screen entertainment is relatively new and british think dvd label specializing in smutty and excessively violent cult movies â mostly italian ones from the glorious eras when everything was possible namely from the late 60 up until the mid 80 the label selection feels like crossover between the oeuvres of mondo macabro and no shame they probably even borrowed the name of the latter and they already released some really rare sick italian puppies like ratman my dear killer killer nun phantom of death and torso the frightened woman was completely unknown to me but since fellow reviewers from around here whose opinions hugely value described it as one of the greatest and most mesmerizing psychedelic euro sexploitation movies of its era didn hesitate to pick it up this is very weird film and probably not suitable for about 99 of the average cinema loving audiences if you re part of that remaining 1 however you re in for really unique treat the style atmosphere and content are similar to jess franco succubus and massimo dallamano venus in furs yet they re both widely considered as classics whereas the frightened woman is virtually unknown it all matter of profiling and good marketing guess the story revolves on literally filthy rich doctor he lives in gigantic secluded mansion owns multiple old timer cars and has very impressive collection of artsy relics including life size mannequin doll replica of himself with bizarre and slightly offbeat attitude towards women he considers them threat for the survival of the male race and thus spends his days kidnapping humiliating and sexually abusing random he picks up from the street dr sayer then abducts the ambitious journalist maria with the intention to completely crush her female spirit but he slowly falls for her just he starts to believe in actual love she strikes back with vengeance this really isn for everyone but if you can appreciate moody sinisterly sexy ambiances bizarre scenery toys and psychedelic touches that seem utterly implausible and surreal you can consider this one top recommendation it slow stylishly sleazy and totally bonkersâ shameless entertainment all right &#39;,

 &#39; mukhsin is beautiful movie about first love story everyone probably has one and this is writer director yasmin ahmad story of hers with boy called mukhsin we know that her movies have been semi autobiographical of sorts having scenes drawn upon her personal experiences and it is indeed this sharing and translating of these emotions to the big screen that has her films always exude warm sincerity and honesty mukhsin is no different and probably the most polished ad confident work to date though must add as personal bias that sepet still has special place in my heart br br our favourite family is back pak atan mak inom orked and kak yam though this time we go back to when orked is age 10 the characters are all younger from the movies we ve journeyed with them from rabun to gubra and here sharifah amani sisters sharifah aryana and sharifah aleya take on the roles of orked and mak inom respectively which perhaps accounted for their excellent chemistry together on screen nevermind that their not playing sibling roles the only constant it seems is kak yam played by adibah noor and even pak atan has hair on his head through mukshin the movie we come full circle with the characters and the world that yasmin has introduced us to we come to learn of and understand the family little bit more set in the days when they re still living in their kampung revisited back in rabun where orked attends chinese school and packs some serious combination of punches and you wonder about that burst of energy in gubra well she had it in her since young the perennial tomboy and doted child of the family she prefers playing with the boys in games rather than mindless masak masak with the girls and favourite outings include going with the family to football matches br br the arrival of boy called mukhsin mohd syafie naswip to the village provides cool peer for orked to hang out and do stuff with cycling through the villages climbing trees flying kites and as what is desired to be explored the crossing of that line between friendship and romance both beautiful emotions br br mukhsin does have its cheeky moments which liven up the story and bring about laughter because some of the incidents we would have experienced it ourselves and sometimes serve as throwback to our own recollection of childhood in short those scenes screamed fun we observe the life in typical kampung where some neighbours are very nice while others the nosy parkers and rumour mongers spreading ill gossip stemming from envy there are 2 additional family dynamics seen one from an immediate neighbour and the other from mukhsin own both of which serve as adequate subplots and contrast to orked own br br as always yasmin movies are filled with excellent music and for mukhsin it has something special the song hujan as penned by her father as well as ne me quitte pas aptly used in the movie given that the yasmin movies to date have been centred around the same characters the beauty of it is that you can watch them as stand alone or when watched and pieced together makes compelling family drama dealing with separate themes and universal issues like interracial romance love and forgiveness fans will definitely see the many links in mukhsin back to the earlier movies while new audiences will surely be curious to find out certain whys and significance of recurring characters or events like that pudgy boy who steals glances at orked br br and speaking of whys parts of mukhsin too is curiously open which probably is distinctive of yasmin style or deliberately left as such thought that as story about childhood recollected from memory then there are details which will be left out for sure and subtly felt that mukhsin exhibited this perfectly with not so detailed details and the focus on what can be remembered in significant episodes between the two br br another highly recommended movie and rare one that feel is suitable for all ages bring along your kid brother or sister &#39;,

 &#39; proof that it not necessary for movie to have deep many layered story and other sophisticated elements to be good movie even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more sociological way people lust for money it seems that it perfect just the way it is through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen br br but the acting for me isn so good with the exception of lindsey mckeon the others were average or even worst in some scenes they just empty stared in front of themselves for exception of lindsey which was more convincing it a really simple movie for just laying back and enjoying br br 7 10 &#39;,
 &#39; the film chaos takes its name from gleick 1988 pop science explanation of chaos theory what does the book or anything related to the content of the book have to do with the plot of the movie chaos nothing the film makers seem to have skimmed the book obviously without understanding thing about it looking for theme to united the series of mundane action sequences that overlie the flimsy string of events that acts in place of plot in the film in this respect the movie choas resembles the canadian effort cube in which prime numbers function as device to mystify the audience so that the ridiculousness of the plot will not be noticed in cube bunch of prime numbers are tossed in so that viewers will attribute their lack of understanding to lack of knowledge about primes the same approach is taken in chaos disconnected extracts from gleick books are thrown in make the doings of the bad guy in the film seem fiendishly clever this of course is an insultingly condescending treatment of the audience and any literate viewer of chaos who can stand to sit through the entire film will end up bewildered how could film so bad be made rewritten as novel the story in chaos would probably not even make it past literary agent secretary desk how could at least hundreds of thousands and probably millions of dollars have been thrown away on what can only be considered waste of time for everyone except those who took home money from the film regarding what in the movie every performance is phoned in save for technical glitches it would be astonishing if more than one take was used for any one scene the story is uniformly senseless the last time saw story to disconnected it was the production of literal eight year old among other massive shortcomings are the following the bad guy leaves hints for the police to follow he has no reason whatsoever for leaving such hints police officers do not carry or use radios dupes of the bad guy have no reason to act in concert with the bad guy let me strongly recommend that no one watch this film if there is any other movie you like or even simply do not hate watch that instead &#39;,

 &#39; the review on the main page admits that the movie is horrible but that you should forgive it because it is nicely violent no you shouldn there are spoilers at the end of this review but how can spoil this rotten movie have no idea even if you are die hard alien pred fan like am wait for the dvd it isn worth 3 99 rental either but you ll be much less inclined to truly hate this film if you pay that than 12 bucks or better per person plus concession purchases at theater br br in the theater watched avpr there were exactly two laughs both by girl sitting next to me other than that there was total silence throughout no ooohs or that was bad ass nothing imagine being patient on an operating table and just being given the anesthetic now you know what you ll feel like in the theater after the opening scene of avpr br br what was the budget on this movie like war of the worlds mi 3 and other x driven movies the director seems far more involved in what the cgi people can come up with than developing characters or plot spielberg has tried and failed at this several times usually with tom cruise sure the movies make money but should they war of the worlds and minority report had the budget to pay for decent script tom cruise et al and ss himself but were still awful m sure avp wasted 90 of their budget on cg and had no choice but to hire any actor that would say yes even though the casting agent would have done better by going to the supermarket and picking actors at random br br there is no tension developed in any scene so we are never close to being surprised who cares who gets killed we didn know any of them we all know what happens when the lil aliens make their corporeal exit we all know the blood is acid in alien aliens 3 resurrection and even avp the directors make use of the fact that the aliens can think can hide and can lay traps this director decided that the ridley scott james cameron and others were idiots for developing characters you actually want to see either live or get killed in this installment you will never care who lives or dies not kid parent pregnant woman the characters serve only one purpose in this movie to die the opening scenes establish the fact that the movie is going to be predictable joke the character development scenes mix clichã bad humor and bad acting and numb the viewer to the point where we really don care if they get killed so long as they die in never before seen ways but they don the director tried to make something different from those who preceded him in the alien franchise but only succeeded in discarding the good parts of the first films the human protagonists and stealing the rest from other recent sci fi films br br there is not one original use of the either the alien or pred characters the pred actually has little trouble killing aliens by the dozen even though the last movie led us to believe that pred revered the aliens as such deadly foe that they used the killing of one as rite of passage the alienpred is never really developed as fearsome creature its ability to inject parasites into host is ripped from several different movies most recently probably was hellboy where samiel dismembered tongue injected eggs into hellboy or doom where the mutated creatures would leave their tongues behind after they speared victim throat br br simply put we aren given reason to care about anything in this movie there is violence but it doesn shock or surprise and is nothing that hasn been seen in any of hundred slasher flicks the cg is ok and both species of alien are made to look and move as they have in movies past but since the characters are never developed and the acting is so bad we kind of hope that they all die the little girl was probably the best actor of the bunch but sadly we aren made to care whether or not kids women or anyone else lives or dies we just want the movie to end eventually it does but not before another stolen plot line from resident evil 2 has nuke aim gunnison way to wipe out the infection and not before yet another stupid scene that is supposed to open the door for further sequels but does it in movie filled with bad scenes the worst may have been saved for last br br sorry for the repetition but everything bears repeating bad script no plot unoriginal action scenes uninspired direction abysmal acting decent x that were wasted because of the many flaws br br don mind going to an indie film and being disappointed the actors and directors and crew are probably getting their careers going and working on shoestring budget for movie with this type of budget and hype feel cheated along with disappointed this movie is painfully boring waste of time from the opening scene to closing credits sad to say that preview of hellboy 2 was the best part of avpr and hb2 didn even look that good &#39;,
 &#39; probably new zealands worst movie ever made br br the jokes they are not funny used from other movies just plain corny the acting is bad even though there is great cast br br the story is uninteresting boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting has been do 1 000 times before br br watched this when it came on tv but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it br br this movie sucks br br do not watch it br br watch paint dry instead &#39;,
 &#39; in this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding images of abu ghraib or tales of forced detentions at guantanamo bay gavin hood rendition is about as up to the minute and timely movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream hollywood it not by any stretch of the imagination perfect film but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum br br the term rendition refers to the ability of the cia to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings then to whisk them away in secret to foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time all without due process of law anwar el ibrahimi is an egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the united states he has an american wife young son and new baby on the way he seems very unlikely candidate for terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with terrorist organization that anwar claims to know nothing about br br on the negative side rendition falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character the ostensible focal point is douglas freeman rookie cia agent who is brought in to observe anwar interrogation at the hands of egyptian officials the problem is that as conceived by writer kelley sane and enacted by jake gyllenhaal freeman seems too much of naã ve boy scout to make for very plausible agent and he isn given the screen time he needs to develop fully as character we know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end he goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within thus without strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams with story elements flying off in all directions similar problem occurs with anwar distraught wife played by reese witherspoon woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface gyllenhaal and witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are hemmed in by restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond single recurring note in their performances br br what makes rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie closing stretches it may make for slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is hollywood after all and the film has to pay some deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted let alone see the light of day as completed project br br two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film omar metwally who makes palpable the terror of man caught in real life kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken and yigal naor who makes surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator torturer meryl streep alan arkin and peter sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of dion beebe br br does the movie oversimplify the issues probably does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces most definitely one wonders how the movie would have played if anwar really were terrorist yet the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground it isn afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes it openly ponders the issue of just how does nation hold fast to its hard won principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear and just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being branded terrorist appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power the movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme islamic terrorism br br thus to reject rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good rendition may not be perfect but it is good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live and that alone makes it very much worth seeing &#39;,
 &#39; it is hard to believe that anyone could take such great book and and make such terrible movie br br imagine king kong being recast as an organ grinder monkey and fay wray part being played by young boy how about elton john as rambo this movie is even worse than the tv remake of the night of the hunter br br by using the title watchers and dean koontz name the makers of this movie should be sued for fraud by readers of the book who expected reasonably accurate adaptation of the book br br read the book have never talked to anyone who didn like it another good book is the winner by david baldachi &#39;,
 &#39; thought rachel york was fantastic as lucy have seen her in kiss me kate and victor victoria as well and in each of these performances she has developed very different and very real characterizations she is chameleon who can play and sing anything br br am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding rachel performance in lucy even some bonafide tv and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal so many people have focused on the fact that rachel doesn really look like lucy my response to that is so what wasn looking for superficial impersonation of lucy wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown and rachel certainly gave us that in great depth also didn want to see someone simply doing classic lucy routines therefore was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have rachel portray lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits vitameatavegamin and the candy factory it seems that some of the reviewers didn realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits this approach thought gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart also thought rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes and she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated the professor and the grape stomping in particular there was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of rachel mouth had the exact little upturn that remember lucy having couldn believe she was able to capture that and so naturally br br wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the lucille ball of love lucy throughout the entire movie after all those of us who came to know her only through tv would not have any idea what lucy was really like in her early movie years think rachel showed natural progression in the character that was brilliant she planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge given the right set of circumstances lucy didn fit the mold of the old studio system in her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts br br believe that rachel deftly captured the comedy drama wit sadness anger passion love ambition loyalty sexiness self absorption childishness and stoicism all rolled into one complex american icon and she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing lucy was star turn for rachel york hope it brings flood of great roles her way in the future also hope it brings her an emmy &#39;,
 &#39; have to say the first watched this film was about 6 years ago and actually enjoyed it then bought the dvd recently and upon second viewing wondered why liked it the acting was awful and as usual we have the stereo typical clansmen in their fake costumes the acting was awful at best tim roth did an ok job as did liam neeson but ve no idea what jessica lange was thinking br br the plot line was good but the execution was just poor m tired of seeing scotland portrayed like this in the films braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace but seriously people didn speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have glaswegian accents just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the americans and to be honest can see why they like it know they have an infatuation for men in kilts however if you are thinking of buying the dvd d say spend your money on something else like better film &#39;,

 &#39; or better yet watch fandango if you want to see really intelligent and funny male college age road flick rolling kansas sounded promising in fact the program guide gave it 2 5 out of 4 stars which usually means it fairly watchable but pretty much fast forwarded through it usually road trip movies have great music but can even recall whether there was music the only high point was small role with rip torn as wise old hitchhiker guru otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way the four main characters are unknown actors and don remember seeing any of them in another movie oh yeah see that thos hayden church was in it but he in everything good bad or indifferent this movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you re not &#39;,
 &#39; sharky machine is easily one of burt reynolds best efforts it also stands as one of the best contemporary crime dramas erotic and violent the movie distinguishes itself by setting the story in atlanta and delivering chaotic detective case to you the viewer on silver platter dedicated and determined sharky must stop the murder of dominoe lovely lady of the night who clientel is anything but ordinary before long sharky crimefighting machine uncovers conspiracy of the highest order which threatens to corrupt the inner body of atlanta as resident of metro atlanta recall the excitement in town during the movie production sharky machine goes to great lengths to give an accurate portrayal of atlanta twenty years removed and 2 000 000 more people later the film stands the test of time trust me atlanta has not changed one of the highlights of the picture is dar robinson daring stunt classic symbolic ending it was even featured on that incredible abc reality show of the period it just too bad that hollywood does not make enough films like this one kick back each your popcorn and watch sterling silver cinema action &#39;,
 &#39; winchester 73 is great story and that what like about it it not your everyday western it uses rifle which passes hands from various characters as mechanism for telling the story about these people rock hudson plays an indian chief jimmy stewart plays great leading man with heart and strength and shelly winters plays gal who has to cope with the realities of her husband and the wild west it important to note for those politically correct types they kill lot of indians in this movie without remorse by today standards it still pretty violent but it a great story and worth watching enjoy &#39;,
 &#39; gypsy is possibly the greatest musical ever written so it too bad that it film version was such disappointment to make up for that we have this re make which if not flawless is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical the script is completely accurate all the songs included and the staging remains close to the original jerome robbins staging bette midler is deft choice for rose her singing and personality merman esquire and her acting splendid peter reigert is fine herby if not great singer and cynthia gibb is straight forward natural louise in truth live taping of the 1989 revival with tyne daly might have been better idea if only because gypsy is simply more exciting on stage but this film is fine translation of great musical &#39;,
 &#39; this is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be friday the 13th 1980 clone the poster for this movie makes it look like there going to be some sort of cross between jason and freddy which is likely to attract movie goers there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie it just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers 1988 on video or dvd and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie br br angela baker pamela springsteen is camp counselor at camp rolling hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who was once man who underwent sex change operation years earlier who knows who cares br br the 1980s was home to lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres in which mad killer goes berserk some have plot some don but they re all about as bad as this one sleepaway camp ii unhappy campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated that all this movie is it is just mindless bloody violence br br watching this movie was reminded of the friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death the filmmakers of sleepaway camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers the world is totally evil place this movie tells you and it ll kill you it doesn matter what your dreams or your hopes are it doesn matter if you have new boyfriend or new girlfriend it doesn matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are you can forget those plans because you re just going to wind up dead br br and the sickest thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for sequel well why not they ve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies missed out on the original sleepaway camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original and for parents if you know kids who actually like this movie do not let them date your children &#39;,
 &#39; this is the worst movie that have ever seen at first thought that it was going to be good because m interested in the bermuda triangle but instead it was terrible all it did was offer bunch of lame explinations that didn make sense if time moves differently there how come the woman didn age and her son aged rapidly and have horrible sappy ending next time the guys who made this go to bermuda they should take all copies of this movie with them please everyone vote for this movie so it can get on the worst movie list &#39;,
 &#39; this has been edited for space br br chan wook park new film is complex film that is not easy to classify nominally horror movie the central character is vampire the film actually has elements of comedy theology melodrama cultural invasion and its analog of viral invasion of body romance and few other things as well it a film that has almost too much on its mind the film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic european literature in this case emile zola thã rã se raquin it an odd mix that doesn always gel but none the less has an incredible power here it is almost 24 hours since saw the film at lincoln center with post film discussion by the director and find my cage is increasingly rattled its not so much what happens is bothersome its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring lot of bells in retrospect br br the plot of the film has will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for medical experiment to find cure for terrible disease infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies but because of transfusion of vampiric blood its not explained he actually survives hailed as miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick unfortunately all is not well the priest finds that he needs blood to survive he also finds that he has all of the typical problems of vampire and its no not possible for him to go out during the day things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with childhood friend and his family the priest some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend from there it all goes sideways br br an ever changing film this is story that spins through variety of genres as it tells the very human story of man who finds that his life has been radically altered by chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was it a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else its also film that has great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in variety of ways br br the film has enough going on that one could and people probably will write books discussing the film br br the two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance the vampire part of the tale is brilliant there is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside sitting in the theater last night found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking here is vampire who just wants to have normal life it contrasted with what happens later it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn going to work its not the dark world of twilight or lost boys rather its something else personally think that the film changes the playing field from hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible the sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool the romance is also wonderfully handled sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done but it the other stuff the looks the talk the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special love the looks the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected and the mad passion of possible consummation this is one of the great screen romances of all time it perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love and lust if you ve ever loved deeply m guessing you ll find some part of your hear on screen know did the statement just wanted to spend eternity with you has sad poignancy to it it both statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion the tragic romance will break your heart br br won lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great its not as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great especially the actors who have unjustly failed to hail as amazing the whole doesn always come together the various genres thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other frequently was wondering where the film was going hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly br br liked the film great deal loved the pieces more than the film as whole its been pinging around in my head since saw it and m guessing that it will do so for several days more like or love is irrelevant since this is film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward one of the meatiest and most filling films of the year &#39;,
 &#39; the idea behind this movie was great the story of little girl facing abuse both emotional and physical and trying to deal with it and survive what makes the movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and the corny dialog the actors have to point out the most obvious things over and over again also there is very tedious almost funny overuse of metaphors in the voice overs the high point is the acting of the little girl nice try but this one a stinker &#39;,
 &#39; dear god kept waiting for this movie to get started then waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither just sat there dumbfounded that 1 it could possibly be this bad and 2 that had just wasted couple of hours on just sheer stupidity had faith that drew couldn possibly have made this bad of movie and boy did ever lose my faith don bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived can believe script this bad ever got funded it had million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didn go anyplace its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasn the worst baffles me because believe me if it got any worse d have slit my wrists before finishing it &#39;,
 &#39; first let me start off by saying this film sounded very interesting serial killer copycatting the works of edgar allan poe who is one of my writers of all time sounds cool right yeah definitely not probably the worst film ve ever seen ever and that not an exaggeration ve seen lot of very very bad movies this one takes the cake and was even prepared for bad movie before going into it br br perhaps the writer should ve studied some law enforcement procedure if you have the name of the killer his entire life history criminal record and his address where is the first place you should look hmm possibly his house what no that a preposterous idea anthony how could you suggest something so obvious and level headed rather than going to bowling alley spoilers end honestly sometimes can forgive movie if the writing is good but the acting is bad or vice versa but this just had everything wrong with it you could possibly find br br think my biggest pet peeve was how the police fbi acted br br for example black fbi agent okay endangered female just sit here in this car in an empty parking lot while go inside and look around the potential crime scene where serial killer is supposed to be sound good to you moronic female fbi agent yeah sounds okay to me go right ahead ll be sure to not focus on my surroundings or at least check the perimeter black fbi agent excellent that what would do honestly if you want to be in law enforcement rent this movie so you can learn how not to act or if you re human and want to learn the same br br 0 5 10 half point just for getting film produced and in stores congrats br br ap3 &#39;,
 &#39; have not read the book that this was based upon inspired by this being some of the others are film roles the last work of john ritter rip one hopes that it is hilarious and it is almost every time he present in this as matter of fact most of the cast supporting as well as regular play off each other well and the material tends to be great he plays paul hennessy the father of three teenagers rory the typical guy of that age kerry the depressive middle child who fights for causes and awareness and bridget the fashion loving popular ditz sagal makes return to being the female lead in sit com and her character is far removed from peggy bundy the show changed somewhat after mr three company passed on and for while they couldn seem to make up their minds if they wanted to go for getting laughs or being poignant and making sure to be respectful one can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that it could still be quite good some of the additions were fortunate if you like david spade most of his part consists of him doing his schtick and had stuff to say my personal favorite episode is in the last season the humor is nice mix of dumb person jokes mainly related to the high schoolers silliness dark comedy and crude material this dealt with sex and other adult topics but never in graphic manner the language is mild and on occasion moderately strong recommend this to any fan of those who made it 8 10 &#39;,

 &#39; in theory films should be form of entertainment while this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film making most movies specially genre films must not only tell it story or message they must entertain their target audience in some way all this just to say that in my opinion bad movie is not movie with low production values or low budget bad movie is one that is boring br br hellborn or asylum of the damned as is known in the s is bad movie simply because it is just not involving and irremediably boring and tiresome while it has very good premise it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting doesn make things better on another hands the film probably could had been fine or even classic movie but here it is just bad attempt at film making br br director philip jones tells the tale of james bishop matt stasi young psychiatry resident who just got his dream job at st andrew mental hospital but the old asylum seems to hide secret after the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices james decides to find out what is going on only to find the incredulity of his boss dr mccort bruce payne who believes that bishop is going as insane as his patients br br while the premise is quite interesting the execution of the film leaves lot to be desired in an attempt of making supernatural psychological thriller jones goes for the easy way out and makes movie filled with every clichã of the genre of course there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clichã but in hellborn every single one is wasted and turned into cheap jump scare to keep things moving resulting in boring and predictable storyline br br the acting is quite mediocre for the most part with one big exception bruce payne gives top notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting matt stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances br br despite all this flaws one thing has to be written about hellborn it has visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big budget hollywod horror productions also the make up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good sadly the rest of the special effects are awful and outdated making huge contrast with the make up prosthetics br br hellborn is movie with few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results hardcore horror or movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is boring and tiresome experience 3 10 &#39;,

 &#39; have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel jane eyre both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane ve seen other versions but none compare to this one the best one for me could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again the last time saw this one was in 1984 when was only 13 at that time was bookworm and had just read charlotte bronte novel was completely enchanted by this miniseries and remember not missing any of the episodes d like to see it again because it so good &#39;,
 &#39; this review is for the extended cut of this movie br br first watched dragon lord when bought it on dvd many years ago always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea br br that being said ve always found the storyline bit confusing the movie is after all love story and it always seemed strange to me that love story should end with 20 minute fight scene br br well in the extended version this is no longer so the old original version begins off with huge barrel climb rugby like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version the opening sequence is dragon jackie chan hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around br br other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes lot more sense when you watch it the pacing is also better and overall it just works better it feels more like love story and doesn leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does br br suggest everyone who is hong kong cinema or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended or at least that how think it was intended why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes when was done watching it felt like had watched completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same &#39;,

 &#39; this is the worst movie have ever seen the story line is joke the effects are terrible the cinematography doesn fit the tone of the movie the dialogue is cheesy and the actors do good job at screwing up the rest people just don act that way in real life situations my question is who would fund such crap br br the movie starts where some miners fall down mine shaft after fireman fails to save them next we join some bikers in forest who ride around doing stunts on their bikes one guy falls and breaks his leg or something the fireman arrives to help them meanwhile somebody starts fire some more bike stunts bla bla bla br br wasted my time br br do not watch this movie &#39;,
 &#39; my husband and just got done watching this movie was not expecting it to be this good was really astonished at how great the story line was m usually very good at figuring out twisty plots but this one had me loved it m going to have to watch it again before take it back might even have to buy it &#39;,
 &#39; last year fell in love with the tim burton version of sweeney todd so wanted to check out the other versions of this musical and found this one at the library though think burton is best probably because like film lot better than theater this is still great production of the story haven seen any of the other versions but am trying to get my hands on them br br after seeing johnny depp as todd it hard for me to imagine anyone else in the role but george hearn does fantastic job angela lansbury is great as always and all of the singing is fantastic found myself singing along this is play you won want to miss but try and see it before you see the film version so you won have biased view like me &#39;,
 &#39; first saw enchanted april about five years ago loved it so much that my husband surprised me with copy the following christmas it about two women who decide to rent castle in italy for the month of april leaving their humdrum lives behind them they are very sad women at the outset of the film and you can help but root them on as they plan this get away with two other women they invite along to share the expenses this is perhaps the most feel good movie have ever seen it pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths it was made with care and in very good taste you cannot help but smile all through it except when you re crying happy tears &#39;,
 &#39; this is going to be the most useless comment have ever put down but yet must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that freddy dead is it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time it was boring pointless and nearly death free the horrible 3 ending and over the top corny kills are enough to drive this film into the ground however it doesn stop there just add bad acting terrible script and number of cheesy cameos and you ve got yourself this heaping pile of guano it no wonder why freddy as always played by robert englund has made two postmortem appearances would too if went out like that this is strictly fans only movie don stare at our shame &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of the movies of dev anand who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie industries such as jewel thief and guide the story is short if you ask me what is the story plot is simple brother seeks for his lost sister sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant hare rama hare krishna yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70 hippie culture their submission to drugs freedom escaping duty family and adopting anything new such as eastern which was new for whites religion they have been handled perfectly zeenat gave her best and dev as usual was remarkable songs are the best used unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs in this movie they have not been spoiled one perfect example is dekho deewano ram ka naam badnam na karo each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie overall devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful nepal of 70 &#39;,
 &#39; as an aging rocker this movie mentions heep and quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline just love this piece of creative genius cannot recommend it more highly and mick jones added so much foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever lou gramm have watched this great work more than 10 times bill nighy what voice and jimmy nail talent oozes from every pore then astrid and karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 10 10 bloody brilliant br br alastair perth western oz originally from windsor england &#39;,
 &#39; winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after wwii director anthony mann must get lot of credit for his excellent direction jimmy stewart does an excellent job but think stephen mcnalley and john mcintire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in high stakes poker game with the treasured winchester 73 going to the winner this is good script with several stories going on at the same time look for the first appearance of rock hudson as young bull thank god with in few years we would begin to let indians play themselves in western films the film is in black and white and was shot in tucson arizona would not put winchester 73 in the category of stagecoach high noon or shane but it gets an above average recommendation from me br br &#39;,
 &#39; prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and there a good reason for that because it not one of the best but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser known smaller films the film does have some connection to blockbusters for start it an early directorial effort for renny harlin the capable director behind number of action films including die hard 2 cliffhanger and deep blue sea and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting we focus on prison that has been reopened after number of years this was the prison where man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison governor naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance br br the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base this is good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesn really have plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in decade of excess the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights as the film goes on we start to delve more into the back story of the vengeful convict ghost and while it fairly interesting some things about it don make sense and it drags the film down little still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall have to say that prison is film well worth tracking down &#39;,
 &#39; butch the peacemaker evidently after the violent beginning with spike tom and jerry all swinging away at each other butch calls halt and wants to know why it a good question br br cats can get along with dogs can they he asks tom who nods his head in agreement mice can get along with cats right jerry nods no and then sees that isn the right answer br br they go inside and butch draws up peace treaty complete with professional artwork most of the rest and the bulk of the cartoon is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what refreshing change of pace found it fun to watch can million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head br br anyway you knew the peace wasn going to last big piece of steak spells the death of the peace treaty but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom jerry clever humor &#39;,
 &#39; like in so many movies of the past you would think hollywood would learn this by now makes for very disappointing movie not to mention make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom br br maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us why the long walk in the woods and can city guy really go through the woods without getting lost just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end br br had to listen to part of the director comments in the special features section from the great moves that redford has made in the past sneakers for one surprised he agreed to star in such film the director comments and reasons were weak br br the best parts of this movie was the scenery can wait for spring to come &#39;,
 &#39; saw this film at special screening at first thought the movie would be like typical amanda bynes movie but was wrong the movie is based on the shakespeares book the twelth night this movie tells the story of girl who lives to play soccer well when the girls team is cut she has to go to great lengths to get on the guys team at different school to get revenge on the egotistical guys team at her old school on her way she gets caught up in long tangled web of love lies and deception this movie is this years mean girls think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are defiantly some big stars to be featured in this movie &#39;,
 &#39; de palma technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film which is wonderful showcase of his classic techniques though unfortunately as with many of the films written by de palma himself the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale br br the story opens with crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in shower while she looks at her husband she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously nearâ and the whole thing is revealed to be angie fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed she has short scene with her son dead ringer for harry potter which concludes with joke that she ll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter she then goes to her therapy session where she complains about her dead marriage before attempting to seduce her therapist michael caine he refuses and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled br br then begins bravura 22 minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as purely visual medium of telling storiesâ and in typical de palma fashion he turns this into way to show off his formidable skill the problem for me is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director skill br br the sequence begins with angie at an art museum she watches strangers all involved in sexual or family activities then begins to get turned on to man sitting next to her de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without single word about angie attraction embarrassment retreating and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of taxi cab all set to wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio who also scored carrie br br in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy and gets up to return to her husband again de palma crams ton of narrative in without word of dialogue uttered as angie realizes that she doesn have her panties that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is that she has probably contracted venereal disease and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle it all very admirable but one begins to feel little strung along as we are forced to do things like take long elevator ride down from the seventh floor then up again almost in real time br br spoilers from here on out when angie reaches the seventh floor again she is killed by big woman with blond hair the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there there is wonderful slow motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator angie reaches up toward her and the killer blade is held poised to slash nancy hands then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror it all good and by the time we have some dialogue again you think woah that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative or maybe you don but do br br younger dennis franz has great part as sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him he interviews michael caine making the outrageous implication though it passes as commonplace that angie wanted to be killed angie son is there as well and he hooks up with nancy and they set about to spy on caine therapist and find out who the killer is br br once again there is strong tie to hitchcock film in this case psycho just as obsession is re working of vertigo you have woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly slut who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space in this case an elevator rather than shower then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation which reveals that the killer is man who dresses as woman to kill de palma even throws in doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing br br it is very interesting but at the same time viewer can begin to feel bit jerked around and that is my primary reservation about this film it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma greatest setpieces but that feeling that the story is running solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole hearted affection br br check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies cinema de merde cinemademerde com &#39;,
 &#39; just got around to seeing monster man yesterday it had been long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up m glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level true you really can expect too much from hearing the plot rundown but after reading some of the reviews for it was ecstatic mean what trash fan wouldn want to see gore flick about deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make shift monster truck went in expecting cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more this was horror comedy that actually worked the film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor let me list just few reasons why love this movie so much first off is the story it been done to death in so many other flicks college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married he being the 25 year old virgin that he is hops in his vista cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive hidden in the backseat of his station wagon is good buddy harley harley is the loudmouth former friend who laughs and talks just like jack black in high fidelity you can help but like the guy but if he was your friend in real life you have to keep whiffle ball bat handy laugh all you want but have you ever been hit with one to keep him in check so he a little on the obnoxious side to say the least but you can tell that he a loyal friend deep down anyway they re on the road and when they stop in bar they aggravate the locals now they re being stalked by leatherface clone in monster truck that it yeah along the way they pick up gorgeous hitchhiker but m too lazy and hungover to go into that right now so just watch the damn movie br br second thing love was the humor this one had some of the sickest laughs of any movie since cabin fever just how messed up is it well won even go into the whole cat scene and as for the corpse burrito thing ll leave that to your virgin eyes as well the bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and that guy who looked like john turturro bothered me too harley although totally obnoxious frat boy type can really sling off the one liners love the clogs by the way need new pair br br the gore this one pours it on heavy while the first hour plays out as demented road comedy the last third is all about blood and guts if the movie hadn kept such light tone throughout it would have been little disturbing but seeing how it was all played for laughs there is no way possible that you will be bothered by it if you re still in your seat by the time it comes you ll probably see the humor in it too but seriously there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff there was big plot turn that didn see coming and when the credits rolled was completely satisfied had gotten exactly what came for and m really glad that bought it much like cabin fever it going to get lot of replay br br the look of the movie was outstanding there was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing scream late 80s and loved the exaggerated colors it obvious that monster man was done on relatively low budget but much like cabin fever sorry keep comparing the two it actually works in the movie favor cabin fever was an ode to the 70s greats this was the 80s answer to that so take that for what it worth no cgi here this is what we all needed m not exactly sure why it didn get theatrical release because this is everything that jeepers creepers should have been thank god for lions gate &#39;,
 &#39; the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and bunch of nuns christopher lee who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine the cast are not too bad though most have now retired from acting the film has terrible sound effects mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems and it ridiculously pondering at times showing scene of the sky for instance for what feels like hours at time despite this the story is pretty humorous in world is doomed sort of way and the production is adequate interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie meda band writer frank ray perilli and charles band assistant bennah burton despite its plodding nature genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it &#39;,
 &#39; although this was low budget film and clearly last minute it holds certain charm that is difficult to pinpoint tend to believe it is the scriptwriter grant morris see dead dog who despite the warped plot line injected fantastic slice of humour sorely missing in many of today box office hits definitely must see for sunday afternoon laughfest speaking as true single girl and very sceptical this film did not inspire me particularly but did ignite small flame of hope for lovelife not my lovelife so much as my slightly crazy neighbour lovelife who lets her hamster sleep in her bed with her she may find someone &#39;,
 &#39; darr is great movie shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his lady which in this case is juhi chawla little does juhi know in the film that shahrukh has major crush on her and is constantly stalking her have to admit some of the things he did in this movie were pretty creepy like the threatening phone calls never in my life will forget the line love you k kiran br br it just too bad that shahrukh and juhi weren exactly together in the film but juhi and sunny do make fairly good couple in the movie though shahrukh role was pretty psychotic still think he did great job of playing it and can possibly imagine anyone else doing that role no wonder he got an award for darr in 94 br br juhi what can say she looks especially amazing in this film it not that she doesn always look amazing in her other films but darr did give the public wonderful image of her br br as for the music it was excellent especially jaadu teri nazar one of my all time favorite songs also thought tu mere samne was quite nice also br br must see for everyone overall darr deserves 9 10 &#39;,
 &#39; love this movie the cast were all terrific in the portrayal of their various characters judith ivey did so well portraying weak fearful dependent who was passive aggressive in her complaining and self involved character that it was relief to see the character metamorphosis blythe danner was equally appealing in her role as somewhat judgmental jewish mother devoted wife and loving sister jonathon silmerman bob dishy stacey glick and lisa walz performed their roles equally well br br if you enjoy movies that relate to going through challenging times without loosing your sense of humor and hope you will love this movie &#39;,
 &#39; it pretty evident that many of your nights were spent alone if you watched 5 minutes of the actual show instead of watching the commercial you would have seen one of the greatest television shows in canadian history being made too bad you would have been watching it alone probably the reason you hate it no game keys to the vip is hilarious light and funny guys are going to eat this show up my game is tight and can hardly wait to get on this show the chicks were hooooot and the clubs kicked ass ll be watching every week it makes me wonder why more great shows like this one aren being made now it clear that the talent in canada has the ability to produce american quality television &#39;,
 &#39; george saunders is forger who steals rare copy of hamlet killing guard in the process months later an associate of his is selling forgeries of the book for great sums of money one of the forgeries is sold to man working for the nazi not happy at being taken the nazi front man insists on getting his money back at the same time an investigator working for one of the other swindled clients shows up the middle woman in an effort to keep herself safe begins to play all sides against each other and sets up meeting at the new york public library between various parties however as people begin to die the library is locked down and more murders and perhaps some rare book larceny seem to be close to happening complex murder mystery is good little thriller with great cast saunders is joined by richard denning and cast of solid supporting players if there is flaw the film is almost too complicated with plots with in plots and everyone pretty much out for themselves the layers of theft forgery murder and war time intrigue this was 1942 are almost too many for the brief 70 minute running time still its an enjoyable little film with darkness and sense of inescapable doom for some of the characters that clearly marks this as one of the first film noirs until denning shows up we re down among some charming thieves whom we like perhaps even more than the hero but its clear from word and deed this is not going to have completely happy ending and they know it even if they fight it good little film that worth searching out &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was an excellent acted excellent directed and overall had an excellent story ive had real life experiance with boy like radio at the football program in my town weve had mentally challenged boy every year practice travel and have fun with the football team this movie is really true and can identify with it 100 boy like radio just needs to feel like they belong to something they need to feel like their life is worth living thats how radio feels and thats why that type of program is set up at my high school this is very touching movie that im glad has been brought to the big screen my dad and loved it and will always remember this for being movie that tells riveting story of the goodness and kindness of man &#39;,
 &#39; the cars in this movie are awesome the acting in this movie is awful the plot and driving scenes don make much sense and are equally bad if you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster save yourself the trouble and money good movie for racing fans well there is part where they make the mistake of referring to nascar driver as rally car driver if you can tell the difference go watch it you ll have blast it really comes down to this there are really really really nice cars in this movie they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic the acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot if you want to see hot girls turn on mtv or vh1 instead am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such bad movie if the class of the cars were to match that of the movie they should be racing with rusted bicycles &#39;,
 &#39; good animation nice character design and light hearted story make suzumiya haruhi no yuutsu enjoyable to watch br br after my first viewing thought that this anime was pretty good but but was much better on for second watch br br this is because it is done out of chronological order and once you re watch it in correct order you notice connections you didn see before or it may be that you see second meaning to some events you didn notice before you may want to read the original novels not manga by tanigawa nagaru before after seeing this the anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows br br however there are some short stories from the book that are not animated but are referenced to bamboo wishes attached shown in episode 14 overall this anime is actually very good once after brief analyzation of the plot reading the book improves upon it as well it is nice break from the shounen jump anime that seem to be taking over &#39;,
 &#39; film like crossfire puts another film that spreads around its social consciousness e the recent film crash almost to shame not necessarily because either one puts forth its message of intolerance is rotten more significantly although d wager crash throws the hammer down much more thickly in comparison with this but because of how the storytelling and contrivances never get much in the way like with crash maybe it not really necessary to compare the two as crossfire is in its core all deep into the film noir vein like its going out of style it was interesting actually to see what the director edward dmytryk said on the dvd interview where he mentioned that the budget for the photography was significantly lower on purpose so that more could be spent on the actors and the schedule went through at very brisk quick pace but then what comes off then as being incredible about the picture is that you would think looking at many of the lighting set ups that it took lot to do just for small scene like when robert mitchum keeely first goes in for questioning under the captain robert young the contrasts of shadows seamlessly in the room is exquisite that there are many other lighting set ups that go even further with so little marks this as something essential in the realm of just the look of the noir period just take look at shot of characters on stairwell the bars silhouetted against them and see what mean br br but back to the substance part of the film it really story that consists of murder mystery but one that we as the audience don take long to figure on the answer it then more about something else then in the mind and soul of killer that wouldn be found in common crime picture then as there are really no criminals for the most part in the film there a very calculated risk with this then that characters could be too thin just to prop up the worthwhile message against anti semitism but dmytryk direction of his top shelf cast along with really terrific script by john paxton fleshes out the characters least of which for what they should have to not seem too thin alongside the message and what would noir be then without some attitude to go along with it mitchum helps that along even in scenes like between him and young where its very much based in the situation of the story moment e detail in the plot by injecting little sly wit into some of the dialog it may already be there in the lines but he helps make the character with good edge for his scenes br br then there also robert ryan who excels at montgomery as man who you know you don like much at first just through his s demeanor but you re not totally sure about either then once it starts to come clearer ironically through subjective view point of the suspect mitchell george cooper at the apartment of the soon to be deceased samuels his performance becomes great balancing act of being full of crap and also rather frightening in his blind way it a good performance when also countered with cooper who has actual personal issues that he faces and comes forward with regret and humility it really after the film ends that one thinks about lot of this however and while you re watching the film it more about getting into the dialog and the flow of the scenes and in the sometimes stark overpowering camera moves on the actors so the message is in way secondary not that it isn an important one especially for the time period coming right off of ww2 but years later its seeing the actors even the ones that don get the big marquee status like gloria grahame as ginny the femme fatale of the picture if it could ve had time for one which it doesn and william phipps as leroy the hick working off one another that sticks much strongly in the compacted screenplay br br dmytryk is also very wise in choosing to limit the musical score is powerful too as for very long stretches we hear nothing and mostly when it does come up it incidental to the character surroundings he could ve just as easily gone with added musical notes on some dramatic scenes for emphasis most specifically the opening audience grabber into the film by sticking clear of that and getting the right attitudes and nuance in camera and cast it uplifts standards in genre material to very fine memorable level my favorite scene would probably go to finley story about an irish immigrant he tells to leroy where all such elements come into place well it might not come in very high at the top of my favorite noirs and d still throw down murder my sweet as the director masterpiece in this kind of picture but it assuredly higher in quality than something of the level too &#39;,
 &#39; lion king 1 1 2 is very fun and addictive sequel don expect the production values of theatrical release but do expect the highest quality of direct to video release br br it is set up as timon pumba begin watching the original lion king in darkened theater and abruptly switch tracks and begin narrating their own story this is done with frequent comedic interruptions for example during one particular tense moment home shopping commercial pops on and chagrined pumba realizes he has sat on the remote these little moments pepper the movie and whether you find them entertaining or not will greatly depend on your sense of humor if you are particularly bothered by movies that deliberately remind the viewer is watching movie than this may not be your cup of tea br br animation is the best they ve invested in the disney dtv line and is integrated almost seamlessly with the original material the newer independent material uses lot of the artistic style of the original the voice talents are all well performed though couldn help thinking of marge simpson every time heard julie kavner br br many of the jokes in the movie will be well recognized by viewers as recycled over the generations but are presented more with the familiarity of comfortable quirks of old friends than annoyingly repetitive br br the music has made me realize how much enjoyed and miss good musical integrated with disney feature the toe tapping opening feature of dig tunnel is well choreographed and hilarious timon and pumba take on the lion king opening sequence and their introduction to paradise are also amusing the only problem was the reprise of the dig tunnel at the end of the movie switching its lyrics and tune from defeatist to uplifting br br story line is pretty well done and the integration of new plot elements is done almost perfectly though the final bit during the hyena chased stretched the storyline credibility little the new story doesn seem to handle saccharine or emotionally charged moments to well and does better when it is resorting to full comedy br br overall worth purchasing if you like all the bonus features that come with typical 2 disc set then go for it for the penny pincher who still is willing to invest on good flick wait until it drops four or more dollars and go rent it right away br br damion crowley &#39;,
 &#39; when this was released thought this was one of the most profane films ever made however thanks to martin scorcese and few other filmmakers like him there have been mainline films worse language wise than this but this is pretty brutal assault on one ears hey can take lot of it but this got ridiculous in the first six minutes alone heard half dozen usage of the lord name in vain plus an untold number of words wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 couldn have been the only one br br not surprisingly some of the feature actors included jennifer jason leigh burt young jerry orbach and rikki lake since this film stephen lang seems to have improved his image at least playing the godly stonewall jackson in gods and generals lang role here is just the opposite perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and character who falls in love with transvestite by the end of the film br br depressing gloomy semi pornographic repulsive these are just few of the adjectives people used even some liberal critics in describing this story which is painted even worse in the novel of course some of the better known critics all extreme libs praised the movie however they were the only ones most critics were disgusted as well almost all of the paying public it unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this br br trust me on this there are no good likable characters in this entire movie this is mean sick film one of the worst of the modern era that is unless you enjoy seeing child abuse drug abuse teen prostitutes on and on two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people no thanks &#39;,
 &#39; was so surprised when saw this film so much underrated understand why some of you dislike this movie its pace is slow characteristic of japanese films nevertheless if you are absorbed in the film like me you will find this not problem at all br br must say this is the best comedy have ever seen shall we dansu is often considered masterpiece of japanese comedies it is very different from hollywood ones g austin powers or scary movies in which gag is guaranteed in every couple of minutes rather it is light hearted movie that makes you feel good br br love the movie because it makes me feel real the plot is straightforward yet pleasing was so delighted seeing that sugiyama the main role has found the meaning of life in dancing before watched the film was slightly depressed due to heavy schoolwork felt lost however this film made me think of the bright side of life believed was in the same boat of sugiyama if he could find himself in his hobby why couldn i it reminded me of exploring my own future and discovering the happiness in my daily life br br it is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers while some of you may find the dancing scenes not as perfect as you expect kinda like it as it makes me feel that the characters are really alive learning to dance as the film goes on br br over all this film is encouraging and heart warming as comedy it does its job perfectly it definitely deserves 10 stars br br and yes aoki is funny &#39;,
 &#39; ve tried to reconcile why so many bad reviews of this film while the vast majority of reviews are given rating of between 7 and 10 the reason may be this film is kind of hard to describe in positive review although few have done that quite nicely already this film is confusing depressing and doesn have happy ending still gave pola a rating of 10 because it is basically for me literature and art combined on film that is really my favorite kind of filmmaking ve only seen two of carax films this one and mauvis sang as with this film m being somewhat pretentious when call this one of carax best films but am carax has minimalist style if that type of film does not appeal to you and is boring then it would be best not to watch this but pola was less minimalist than mauvis sang so it had quite lot of intensity for thriller at least for my taste found it quite interesting and absorbing the two lead roles did an excellent job acting mean the lead and the young woman he thought was his half sister catherine is always great but her role was not very large or significant in the story but everyone did fine job thought the cult stuff was great it may have not been very believable but that is due to its being rather abstract there is lot going on between the lines in this film this is very freudian psycho thriller &#39;,
 &#39; maya is woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel fulfilled this could be an interesting topic that would need good story nice setting and good dialogues it doesn have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only lengths and no climaxes the only climax is shahrukh khan but although am huge fan of his couldn stand this movie even he can make this movie exiting the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you re an art house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it it not funny it not interesting it not catching my recommendation don watch it &#39;,
 &#39; this is bad movie not one of the funny bad ones either this is lousy bad one it was actually painful to watch the direction was awful with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly keira knightly was not convincing as tough chick at all and cannot believe lucy liu and mickey rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid the script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across chalkboard if you haven seen it don you are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults this one is just waste of time &#39;,
 &#39; this is an excellent movie and wish that they would put it out on dvd for people to purchase it is difficult to try to catch it on tv all the time as you do not know when one of the stations will decide to air it can someone tell me what file company make it so can write to them and see if they will release it to the public only caught the last hour and half yesterday and only got to see it once last year my sisters and are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos john denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great they put out some much older movies and think that is great but there are quite few that they have not put out and think if we could contact the producers and voice our requests we might get some of them put out on dvd &#39;,
 &#39; it started out with an interesting premise always like civil war stuff and ancient secret societies the more the film progressed the more realized that this was b movie at best in the latter half it quickly became c movie then then then wish that this wasn a rental so that could put it in the microwave can say that the acting in all cases was awful just most the writing however never read the book maybe the book is well written the screenplay was written by 10 year old it was ridiculously shallow the dialog drab and uninteresting the characters about as interesting as 5 pound bag of fertilizer really hated this movie as did my wife am christian and have no problem with movies that promote or support christianity this movie did great disservice to the cause awful terrible worthless if you liked it strongly recommend superman 4 &#39;,
 &#39; film that is so much 30 warners film in an era when each studio had particular look and style to their output unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object br br curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality working methods that were very much the requirements of director at warners studio that was one of the big five majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres br br even though we have setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with narrative that could have been torn from the headlines another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that they re not the trophies gives the film more working mans down to earth feel for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50 when their involvement in television changed their fortunes they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent curtiz has created from an excellent script film that moves along at rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing br br thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub plot so the fun can just keep rolling along &#39;,
 &#39; got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday don know why it took me so long as do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis while it may have bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of modern animated movie there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet br br first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent the composer tries to compromise by doing score that sounds similar but it still just no good enough the gadget mobile is now talking car not car that can turn into van plus it looks lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all br br the plot is non existent there something about transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that all got what the deal was with the short giant italian guy will never know it had nothing to do with anything br br and if the title is anything to go by his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever and he stays on the force so why it called last case is mystery also br br wasn impressed at all this is an affront to great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd but don let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can sold this mere seconds after finally watching it no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it &#39;,
 &#39; bulletproof is quite clearly disposable film the kind where bullet riddled good guys and bad guys are splatted everywhere so much so that you really aren supposed to see them as human the yawns between the lines from wayans and sandler are extensive indeed they try hard but alas and alack persona itself does not good film make jimmy caan plays nifty villain but he always had that redneck edge at the ready my favorite scene is the repeated clips of tv ad in which caan reveals the virtues of america can be shown to the world by having 2 cars in every garage aside from that it a buddy movie with guns for brains pass on this one &#39;,
 &#39; think this movie was made as good as it could have been with only 4 months and 52000 budget m surprised this wasn worse if you are not to care about the cg or special effects this movie is great br br okay the movie is not that well made m sure it could have been but you try to do better in only 4 months but the story is good and the movie is rather exciting br br don trust me when say that this movie is good cause also find the 1933 king kong to be good br br must confess that didn watch the complete movie either might have fast forwarded some minutes here and there &#39;,
 &#39; one of my all time favourite films ever just beautiful full of human emotion wit humour intelligence the story grows as does the lesson of life just wonderful film in so many ways br br the cast are also fantasic great selection of the finest british talent around loved them all for every diverse element brought into the film br br italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form story such as this everything about this film works br br love it &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for movie and thinking to yourself oh want to learn more about custer life and his last stand do not rent they died with their boots on but if you would like to watch movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with little bit of romance and just for good story this is fun movie to watch br br the story starts out with custer errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with libby olivia de havilland br br errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong custer well olivia de havilland plays the cute sweet libby very well especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of callie played by hattie mcdaniel her character will definitely make you laugh br br the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director portrayal of custer was as hero and history shows this is debatable some will watch this movie and see custer as hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him br br give it thumbs up for this 1942 western film &#39;,

 &#39; love the jurassic park movies they are three of my all time favorite movies br br and hate this game if there was one game wish never own for the super nintendo was this one br br how can game based on classic movie be just too awful and to make it worst was scare of this game when was kid br br how dumb was that but then again was kid when this game was first out br br the game play in this game is just odd one minute it a action game and then it a shooter what in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making video game br br the sound in the game is just terrible to listen br br the music is just too sick to listen to br br the controllers in the game don work most of the time br br jurassic park the game is just waste of time and money and won be classic br br avoid at all cost &#39;,
 &#39; wild rebels is fun in bad way but also frustrating due to the actual good or at least workable elements in the story it deals with race car driver steve alaimo who gets mixed up in group of bikers called satan angels who hang around lot until they decide to rob bank meanwhile alaimo also gets recruited by the cops to report back to them what the angels are up to and where they ll rob next it not even that the film is really too dated though it does of course carry the significantly crude and stupid music in the film from the band on stage in one scene to alaimo performing if you could call that drek that to the regular generic score br br it just that there not more care taken by the filmmaker into putting little more logic direction and better actors for the parts as it is didn have major disliking towards the film as did with the hellcats but it almost left me little indifferent to it all too what could come through as being unpredictable only comes through with stupid things like the name of the florida town citrusville ho ho so it not completely un worthy then of its mystery science theater 3000 status as of late the commentary is good on the movie even if once or twice almost wanted to hear what the characters on screen were saying in case it might have some worth wild rebels might be more of good time if you ve got six pack and low expectations but as it is wouldn watch it again &#39;,
 &#39; if this is someone favorite movie they need some serious help there is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest haven seen the original movie this is the remake of some 1950s film but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization br br major gets kicked out of the military for being fringe element and winds up teaching children at an rotc school unfortunately the major is daman wayans so the children are in for world of annoying humorless asininity can wayans whip these losers into shape can they get him to become little more human the film bombs as most wayans films do with only few sparkling moments william hickey gets about one minute of screen time fair too little this charming old man known best to me as tales from the crypt actor known best to you as uncle louis from christmas vacation shines every moment he on screen which isn much here br br bam bam bigelow also makes an appearance as biker which fits him perfectly wouldn mind slightly more bam bam but think he carried the role of biker about as far as it could be carried for military film br br and then there the attractive teacher who someone falls for major payne even though he treats the kids poorly has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with she must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate m not sure which though it would seem stupid since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough br br wayans had one shining moment dance sequence where he performs series of moves including very nice robot and with the help of music from 2 live crew this scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle br br seriously avoid this film if you want to see film bout loser who helps loser kids become heroes rent or buy ernest goes to camp at least he a lovable loser and actually funny maybe if major payne had fought badger d feel better but he didn forget payne forget wayans you can do so much better &#39;,
 &#39; ve seen my share of woody allen movies and while they re not always great you can usually be sure you re going to be entertained probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway 94 and mighty aphrodite 95 since then the ones ve seen have been patchy but watchable and so when was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda which wasn even aware had been released yet went along happily hadn really heard much about it so hoped would be pleasantly surprised br br what got was definitely the worst woody allen movie ve seen the premise is over explained the cast is terrible the script is slow and lifeless too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out assume to fill out what would have otherwise become 15 minute short film br br don mind the concept behind this film two directors discuss how simple situation could be interpreted as comedy or tragedy and obviously the film proceeds to show us that by playing out both scenarios the problem is neither of these two films are any good at all the comedy isn funny and the tragedy isn very tragic it seems like allen came up with good idea but then ran out of steam or time to actually complete the film br br the general level of acting is notably bad also will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table and it basically woody allen impression previously good actors like chloe sevigny just come off as annoying and the worst of the bunch is radha mitchell as melinda which is shame because her character is in nearly every scene br br to be fair to the actors the script they are working with is lacking if not non existent definitely long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall &#39;,
 &#39; the 20th animated disney classic is often criticized by many people as mediocre or poor in quality but it is great movie br br too bad that the aristocats doesn get the deserved credit personally see it as one of my favorite disney classics br br despite being extremely underrated it is one of the funniest disney classics it is full of hilarious some of them hysterical moments br br edgar the greedy butler is the villain of the movie but he is perfect comic relief he one of my favorite disney villains because he is so funny br br every scene with edgar and the hound dogs napoleon and lafayette chasing him are among the most hilarious you ll ever see especially the one when edgar drives his motorcycle into the river and around the bridge with the dogs chasing him that is hysterical br br but the classic humor doesn just come from edgar or the hound dogs other characters have their moments as well br br about the quality subject it isn perfect but remains on high level even after walt disney death those artists knew how to keep faithful to walt spirit and the aristocats is one of those examples they don make them like this nowadays br br as usual legendary disney actors voice the characters in this case we have phil harris sterling holloway paul winchell eva gabor and pat buttram br br the characters are cool in general thomas malley duchess and her 3 kittens the mouse roquefort the alley cats the english geese the hound dogs and the horse the human characters are included as well the eccentric and kind retired opera singer madame adelaide bonfamille the comic madame old lawyer georges hautecourt and edgar himself br br about the soundtrack it has some nice and catchy songs such as thomas malley theme but can remember its name everybody wants to be cat and the aristocats sung by maurice chevalier for example br br this movie takes place in paris france in the year of 1910 above all this is joyful nice and very pleasant movie timeless classic which is often underestimated and forgotten but very worthy br br this should definitely be on top 250 &#39;,
 &#39; m not going to say that this movie is horrible because have seen worse but it not even halfway decent br br the plot is very confusing couldn really figure out what was happening and where things were going when the movie was over was left scratching my head watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it felt like was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br character development is very shallow couldn figure out when somebody was angry or had grudge against someone couldn tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had bad actor to portray them this film seems to be based around stereotypes to it credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making film about singer in rock band which should make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of heroin addict trying to come clean stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters this film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible br br another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation guess that ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that really didn get chance to know any of them so never really missed any of them br br and last but not least was sadie singing it awful the music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie vocal cords swear that there one point in the movie where she sings song for at least 10 minutes seriously thought was going to have to turn it off during this howl thon br br as whole this movie is confusing characters are ill developed georgia acting is wooden and stiff sadie character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation the music was unbearable and can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have thirst for cinematic pain &#39;,
 &#39; we sat through this movie thinking why is this or that scene in the movie what does this have to do with the plot we hoped that by the end everything would be slightly more clear it was not to be br br think the director in fit of pique threw the script up in the air and then some minor and vengeful underling reassembled it randomly with no regard to the scene being filmed possibly with scissors and glue stick br br the film motifs include communism bad nihilism bad poor parenting bad threesomes bad tv bad coherent scripting bad deconstructionism good it really not clear br br finally no german water taxi would ever have an unchained staircase that would let passengers fall in to the water the abundant quantity of achtung signs everywhere is testament to this fact &#39;,
 &#39; on the back burner for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend rhoda morgenstern valerie harper meet in new york after long estrangement and catch up on each other lives what novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making movie about has happened to either of them in the intervening years so instead the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the workplace while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and harper once had together is gone moore allegedly stalled this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably marches on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is travesty and an insult to classic &#39;,
 &#39; the entire civilized world by now knows that this is where emil sitka says his immortal hold hands you lovebirds but shemp howard professor of music steals the show watch him tutoring dee green as she fractures the voices of spring watch shemp as he shaves by mirror suspended from the ceiling by string watch him as he gets walloped by christine mcintyre watch him and you will laugh and learn moe is no slouch either watch him as he attempts to induce woman to sit on bear trap larry as usual is the zen master of reaction all in all one of the very best stooge shorts you won find one weak moment &#39;,
 &#39; m huge fan of war movies and as vietnam combat vet have some experience with the technical details worked with the bomb guys more than once and have nothing but respect for them other vets and iraq vets in particular have summarized the inaccuracies in this movie very well poetic license is one thing but this movie is complete fantasy and fails badly because of it no bomb disposal unit or any unit would ever have tolerated this rogue operator for more than 5 minutes military units prize conformity and discipline for reason it saves lives the opening scene particularly annoyed me the guy with the cell phone would have been shot immediately yelling stop dialing is not an effective deterrent it got worse from there the scenes with the sniper were particularly egregious as others have noted your average eod guy doesn know jack about being sniper and to think any arab sniper is that good really stretches the imagination kidnapping an arab businessman for some form of personal revenge just wouldn happen somebody might shoot him but this kind of risk taking is limited to the movies could go on but as said others have pointed these things out in detail this is not good movie and if it wins any awards at all it a further reflection of why la la land is so named &#39;,
 &#39; all right here the deal if you re easily offended then you might want to stay far far away from this one there are some painfully funny moments in the movie but probably blushed about as much as laughed actually probably blushed more than laughed and if wasn literally blushing on the outside then was blushing on the inside if there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame whether that a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder suppose br br will not deny that laughed quite bit but this is movie that simply cannot give blanket recommendation due to its subject matter if were to say this movie is hilarious go check it out and some sweet little old church going lady heads to the theater and has heart attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations well that just something don need on my conscience br br so how raunchy is it hmm try about 100 times worse than the wedding crashers honestly my mom would ve walked out during the first scene feel it my duty to at least warn you of what to expect br br there is some cleverly intelligent comedy here but that what come to expect from the man judd apatow who had hand in both freaks and geeks and undeclared m all for making fun of michael mcdonald the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give kenny rogers run for his money paul rudd proclaiming if hear ya mo be there one more time ll ya mo burn this place down is hilarious but it one of those things that the majority of the audience won appreciate br br and when we see quick 3 second flashback of steve carrell singing along to cameo word up laughed for good two minutes after the joke was over whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it br br strangely enough despite the raunch there an admirable moral to the story the movie doesn portray carrell as some freaky loser just because he a virgin he really portrayed as likable admirable character sure he a little weird after all he has framed asia poster more videogames than an asian kid and toy collection that features the million dollar man boss but we re never led to believe that there actually anything wrong with the fact that he a virgin as odd as it may seem there a bit of an it ok to wait message br br but man oh man please be warned that this pushes its rating about as far as it can go that was certainly apatow intention according to him he just let some of the guys particularly rogen and malco improv and talk the way they normally talk all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty if you can handle that or talk that way yourself then you ll love the movie br br m not big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes find that subtle clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the word or fratboy sex discussions but that me like said there are some absolutely hysterical moments here but you have to ask yourself if they re worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you re likely to ever see at the theater just don know how interested most women will be in what discussed by men while playing poker honestly ladies you might not want to know if you ve ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross well this gives you good idea br br there you go my humble honest take on what to expect be that your guide it definitely should not be seen with your sunday school class mama grandmama any family members of the opposite sex children of any age or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion if you see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable &#39;,
 &#39; love this film it is excellent and so funny ben is fit and wouldn mind meeting him on holiday rate this film 10 because its gr8 and hope they never re make it because it would never be the same funny bit is wen andre is looking at the moon and he shouts at nicole to come outside and look at the moon that bit always makes me laugh and never gets old another thing is nicole looks lot older then 14 but shes gr8 actress but need help with something does e 1 no the name of the song played at the end wen nicole and andre are dancing its really bugging me because want 2 no what it is because its nice song &#39;,

 &#39; first of all do not look down on americans know lots of people that are intelligent people from the usa but this movie is so utterly bad that just had to comment on it br br first of all movies are mostly far from the truth this movie is no exception lots of scene are so incredibly false for example the departure of the 2 space ships you see them drop off the full tanks in space just small distance from each other remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past just tinsy winsy part that came off in here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship what idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time second of it is that the russian station is piece of crap hate to bring this up to you but astronauts nowadays go to russia since their equipment is much more reliable then nasa the space shuttle is retired and nasa uses it just to pay off the bills and there is no better alternative for it and the list of whoppers goes on and on this is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious and know half as much as these guys do but the most annoying part read the whole movie is the propaganda and patriot crap that get choked with my god thought was looking at cnn business commercial for like an hour the actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with start up fights ignore the police etc etc but when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it bomb detonator maybe lack the feeling of being true patriot that can sing the national anthem backwards in swahili whilst riding with george bush behind the steering wheel of golf cart driving in circles until the battery is empty but this movie was too much for me too handle and when finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the american flag out of my hiney realised that was glad this movie was finally done do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded stereotyping propaganda movie but pity them this represents country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power as long as uncle sam thinks you are good patriot where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated no one cares &#39;,

 &#39; even for tired movie model as the nature vs man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective though entertaining for reasons it was not intending it is sooooo preposterous apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites hundreds of these bites being fatal watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in not so good but very bad way so many scenes just look ludicrous boy trying to fall in dumpster whilst being attacked suzanne sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed robert foxworth and lynda george breathing through pieces of wallpaper bernie casey faking gam leg and the list goes on and on the peril shown ranges from ants crawling from drain to black lines of ants all over the walls the cast for the film is not bad on paper but none of these actors seem to believe in the material poor myrna loy has to sit in wheelchair through this horror hope she found good use for the money for it is obvious that was the only reason woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense although it is quite bad film it is watchable once for me and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities start studded actors embarrassing themselves that made for tv feel and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man this time man must push his hand into pile of ants to be affected really quite dreadful &#39;,

 &#39; the title suggests that this movie is sequel to an american werewolf in london none of the characters from the previous movie return and aren even mentioned in this movie by name so as sequel aawip fails one would say br br dare to say the opposite br br an american werewolf in paris is charming effective horror movie it one of the better werewolf films have seen in long time too and have seen quite my share such as an american werewolf in london the howling wolfen the wolfman and the underworld trilogy br br the story tells of three americans visiting paris on vacation at the top of the eifel tower one of them saves woman trying to commit suicide what starts out as romantic relationship slowly turns into nightmare when the dark secrets that lurk in the city are revealed br br really liked the acting in this film especially the two stars of the movie the woman who tried to commit suicide and the guy who saves her they have good chemistry together but the other two americans also play their roles nicely didn really find anything annoying about the acting so thumbs up for that br br the effects on the werewolves are nice it doesn look too cheap or fake to me of course the opinions are divided about this subject but let just say that wasn disappointed br br there also good amount of humor in this movie there are some really funny scenes you will probably remember for long time br br so to sum it up an american werewolf in paris might not be direct sequel to it predecessor but it still an enjoyable movie perfect for fans of werewolves 7 out of 10 stars &#39;,

 &#39; henry fool surprised me didn expect it to entertain and amuse as well or as strongly as it did fay grim continues to surprise in that it provides solid continuation to story that seems not to need it once the viewer watches the first 20 minutes of the movie however it becomes blindingly aware that this is one of the best sequels to brilliant indie film at least as good as ginger snaps back if not better br br am little disappointed that jeff goldblum part is so small but m happy he is part of this short run he is convincing and delightful as agent fulbright also delight is liam aiken who quite aptly portrays ned grim the son of fay and henry br br this movie is pleasure for so many reasons am pleased for example to discover that henry isn really the loser he seems by the end of fool and to further discover that he is in fact genius well that really is lovely stroke of the pen br br am hoping they do third like the end of the trilogy it seems to be missing they should entitle it ned fool grim and it should be liam looking for his father to validate the awesome change in his mother and the sense of near genius he himself feels welling inside him assuming of course that fay continues withholding many of the most important facts from her son concerning his father it feels like it needs to be done d buy it br br even with more action this is still not an action flick it is more drama and intrigue mystery of sorts ll watch it often br br it rates an 8 3 10 from br br the fiend &#39;,
 &#39; today found they all laughed on vhs on sale in rental it was really old and very used vhs had no information about this movie but liked the references listed on its cover the names of peter bogdanovich audrey hepburn john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me the price was very low and decided to risk and buy it searched imdb and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference looked in mick martin marsha porter video dvd guide 2003 and â wow â four stars so decided that could not waste more time and immediately see it indeed have just finished watching they all laughed and found it very boring overrated movie the characters are badly developed and spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story the plot is supposed to be funny private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing but have not laughed along the whole story the coincidences in huge city like new york are ridiculous ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man with the women falling for him as if her were brad pitt antonio banderas or george clooney is quite ridiculous in the end the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie and whose life was showed in star 80 and death of centerfold the dorothy stratten story the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen the future mrs keith richards the always wonderful even being fifty two years old audrey hepburn and the song amigo from roberto carlos although do not like him roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 and is called by his fans as the king will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions manly dorothy stratten my vote is four br br title brazil muito riso muita alegria many laughs and lots of happiness &#39;,
 &#39; am working at video store so got to see this one for free thank god had paid for it my review would be less forgiving br br well the major idea of the film geeky girl takes bloody revenge isn all that original there are several parallels to carrie playing mean practical joke on loser except for one nice girl that is actually sorry for her tamaras and carries bad family background still think it a fun idea for trashy teen horror flick unfortunately they didn take much advantage of the potentials that are here and rather put an emphasis on all the wrong things br br what worked liked the actress that played tamara she looked great when she was hot and her catty lines were fun sean can come to the phone he f king patrick br br what didn work the whole wicca thing was silly generally prefer rational explanations she could have ploted the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to get her revenge there were lot of logical wholes and the gore looked really bad when the boy is cutting of his ear and his tongue please br br the whole idea wasn bound for oscar buzz but just think they wasted the comedic and the suspenseful potential they had it was bearable but far from good &#39;,
 &#39; plots with view of 2002 is delightful little comedy like only the british could do it the film sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick ish it the only film by director nick hurran ve seen so far and while am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment m not big fan of romantic comedies this one is highly enjoyable and very funny the film takes place in little town in wales where betty rhys jones brenda blethyn is married to the town drunken and adulterous major robert pugh the local mortician boris alfred molina has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood but has always been too shy to confess his love to her apart from being desperately in love boris has some other problems as the eccentric american mortician frank featherbed christopher walken has opened funeral flourishing business in the same town the film odd very british wit should amuse everybody with sense of humor and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre also plots with view profits from wonderful cast brenda bethlyn who has already proved herself to be funny lady in 2000 saving grace plays the lead and she is once again very funny and very lovable in her role alfred molina who plays her shy admirer delivers great performance as always and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty sleazy husband beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband secretary m becoming bigger fan with every film see her in the greatest role however is played by the incomparable christopher walken one of my favorite actors walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox overall plots with view is vastly entertaining little british comedy that highly recommend &#39;,
 &#39; am an actor producer director and what am about to say are facts this project was the worst film in movie making history from producer to director and the edit of this so called film is joke and mean big joke why would blockbuster released such crap take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession was the director trying to make bad movie don think so seen bad zombie movies but this takes the cake the coffie and everything on the damn table this movie sucks really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because am one myself but please consider in taking up different profession respect the fact that you completed movie but have to ask you were you smoking crack mean the makeup on your girls the scary zombies what were you thinking to the whole nation if could have voted zero would have worst film in movie making history &#39;,
 &#39; good movies are original some leave message or touch you in certain way but sometimes you re not in the mood for that br br wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when watched this one it started of good and was quite entertaining so why bad review well in the end the movie lost it credibility the storyline wasn that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was ok so more than enough to satisfy my needs but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with bad feeling they should have put little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten 7 in the no thinking just plain action category so in conclusion if you know you ll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don watch otherwise d say go ahead &#39;,
 &#39; ladies and gentlemen may we present the worst of all disney remakes although the name of this movie is that darn cat it should have been that darn teen or fbi agent the cat didn get any real good scenes ricci character was more annoying than funny doug doug didn get any good lines even dean jones cameo role couldn save this movie the only really good characters were the town only two auto mechanics but their scenes were only brief in all d say that if you are considering watching this movie go get something more intelligent like barney video &#39;,
 &#39; saw this movie and totally loved it the characters are great it is definitely my kind of movie you do not get bored in this movie love independent films they are so much more rewarding my husband and really enjoyed jay style if you are an open minded person who loves thought provoking films and loves conversation after it over you will love this film it is definitely thought provoking the film definitely will step on some toes but who cares those people will probably not go to see this movie it is amazing to see the characters evolve jay floyd has really captured both sides of the table applause applause jay hope you are working on another movie &#39;,
 &#39; since there have been so many reviews of this fine film will write in list form and attempt to address issues that have not been discussed br br 1 dana andrews was 38 during the filming of this movie his character according to the screenplay was in his mid 20s andrews highly underrated actor did brilliantly play character who was supposed to be much younger br br 2 fredric march like all great actors needs at times to be restrained by the director to avoid over the top acting he was mugging for the cameras when he was drunk on the night after his arrival and also the next morning when he was checking out his hang over in his mirror br br 3 dana andrews was superb as he was in laura the ox bowl incident walk in the sun the purple heart and many other films why did fredric march win the academy award and why was dana andrews not even nominated for his outstanding performance br br 4 harold russell gave the best performance have ever seen by non actor br br 5 realize this was the 1940s but dana andrews seemed to have no romantic interest in his exceptionally attractive wife virginia mayo br br 6 ray teal who played the right wing bigot years later became famous for portraying the sheriff on bonanza br br 7 the professor from the south wrote that the film was slow moving boring and poorly acted the professor more than likely is uninformed about classic films the beauty and significance of these ageless classics is that they are slow moving character studies that avoid profanity excessive violence and gratuitous sex br br was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review useful &#39;,
 &#39; alien was excellent many writers tried to copy it they all did bad job or almost but dead space is the worst alien copy because of the bad actors the bad special effects the bad scenario and other bad stuff it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film the movie wasn very long and this is very good thing the only one you cannot laugh because it is too serious that is bad thing because in almost each series sci fi film you can laugh during the whole time it can be terrific sometimes but instead of watching this stupidity just watch alien or event horizon these are much better give it 1 out of 5 &#39;,
 &#39; this movie was masterpiece of human emotions and experience think that lot of people get caught up in leland apparent mental illness as the storyline but was drawn into the relationships of many of the characters and what they reveal about the force of human emotions much of the message of the movie is that we never know the good without the bad which is little clichã but what makes this movie so good and so original is that it very eloquently portrays the crushing and devastating force that the bad can have whether you see the bad everywhere like leland or are experiencing the utter helplessness of unrequited love or relationship that just isn going to work no matter how bad you want it to this movie captures how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie ve seen and it is as depressing movie as it is good &#39;,
 &#39; there hardly anything at all to recommend this movie chase masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act though her role in this clunker is waste unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre in lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make note of them for future reference no such luck here creature unknown clichã monster on the loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other the monster is man in rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of paul blaisdell so bad it good the rest of the show is just so bad it bad little humor might have made this more palatable but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up there is twist or two at the end but by then you won care anymore &#39;,
 &#39; now here is film that if made in australia would have easily been comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from lala land how did the di erector get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were nerdy lonely gay clichã but somehow cute or is that clichã piled upon clichã no value in the story that almost seems like prequel to gus van sant gerry and with title like the fluffer how is it all such lead weight well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he didn get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the unrequited love a bore theme left over from faded streisand lyric we have only moody beefcake and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the gerries into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made similar but actually hilarious film called moneyshot originally filmed as the venus factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey presto comedy tonight lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up guess the fluffer stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform can understand why &#39;,
 &#39; my interest in dorothy stratten caused me to purchase this video although it had great actors actresses there were just too many subplots going on to retain interest plus it just wasn that interesting dialogue was stiff and confusing and the story just flipped around too much to be believable was pretty disappointed in what believe was one of audrey hepburn last movies ll always love john ritter best in slapstick he was just too pathetic here &#39;,
 &#39; has aged really well still thrilling and suspenseful today certainly one of hitch best movies beautifully shot with great premise for suspense sex appeal provided by beautiful ruth roman because of the great premise you feel like you have to watch it to the end if you find yourself losing faith in hitch and doubting his title as the master of suspense recommend this nice little movie as an antidote 5 out of 5 &#39;,
 &#39; this is one of the best movies it is one of my favorites movie with good acting the story is very sensitive and touching good camera work also br br the names of the actresses and actors are not at the top of the american star list however they give equal or better performances than the top of the list br br it is such pleasure to see movie about true love romance friendship without having to endure watching someone having to kick box their way to save the world br br if you don like this movie then you have no heart or feelings then go watch sports movie there is no killing or horror here see the movie it is must th &#39;,
 &#39; bell book and candle was shown recently on cable not having seen it for while we decided to take another look at this comedy based on the james van druten broadway hit which was vehicle for rex harrison and lilli palmer in the early fifties the film was adapted for the screen by daniel taradash the film was directed by richard quine who turned the play into delightful comedy br br evidently judging by some of the comments submitted by imdb the big issue seems to be the pairing of the two stars who had collaborated on vertigo released the same year movie audiences didn think anything about the age difference when this film was released in fact most of the aging male stars of that period were always involved with much younger women br br the film set in manhattan during christmas is delightful comedy that has enchanted viewers kim novak was at the height of her beauty as it clear the camera adored her no matter what was she playing as the witch that becomes human her gillian is charming james stewart who plays the publisher shep henderson is also seen at his best mr stewart was an excellent comedy actor who shows in here why he was at the top br br in supporting roles the wonderful elsa lanchester playing queenie is welcome addition to any movie as she proves here jack lemmon nicky holroyd the brother of gillian is also good ernie kovacs is also seen as the writer sidney radlitch br br this is an excellent way to spend winter night at home watching bell book and candle &#39;,
 &#39; this entire movie is worth watching just for the magnificent final moment its the best ending of any movie ve ever seen perfect beautiful funny simply wonderful br br found this movie delightful even with it french taking itself too seriously deep meanings thing going on loved it it a great love story and loved the way algerians were woven in and by the way the music during the final credits is great want the cd &#39;,
 &#39; granted this seems like good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john cleese in neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and you ll find out br br in truth martin the lead is mis cast he not doing the great slapstick he known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays sort of in between character that doesn work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible cleese is the only even partially funny member br br to top it off the plot is pretty stupid can say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they blunder through new york not doing anything right and unfortuneatly nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who don live in new york aren very bright theme repeated throughout the movie br br in summation instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again &#39;,
 &#39; matthau and lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great the dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where lemmon character attempts to clear out his sinuses in restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time see it anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original recommend this wonderful movie to everyone just love it and the fact the jack lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion these two great guys made string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is simply bad first of all the story is just weird and it not good written it leaves you with questions when you re finished sometimes that ok but not in this case br br the acting is nothing to write home about the adults does ok job but the kids taken in consideration they are kids does not good job thought the lead role ian costello as mickey was worst well to be honest m not sure that was the lead role never quite figured who this movie was about mickey or pete br br there were some shots that stood out but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography the sound however was better there was nice score little adventure kind of score though this didn look like an adventure film to me it had some elements of an adventure film but it was more of drama however it was hard to tell who this film was meant for children hardly there is too much language and violence for that adults don know it had to many elements of children movie in it it was like adult movie in children movie wrapping br br the story was just weird don have much of an idea of what it really was about you was thrown right in to it without knowing anything but there were all the time references to something you felt you should know the fact that the children parents were dead for instance and that mickey blamed pete for it you expected to get to know what happened but you never got br br all together this movie was bad and waste of time there was no drive in it nothing to really move the story forward this is not what you spend your saturday night on &#39;,
 &#39; teenage exorcist is one of those god awful films to video that makes the viewer give up any expectations of decent entertainment for low brow sexual antics adolescent humour and empty writing this film delivers exactly what its was trying to deliver it is about girl moving into house where baron de sade hmmm once lived and finally being drawn to him through her own inner demon her sister and brother in law along with an irish priest her boyfriend and pizza delivery boy try to save her and exorcise her demon well not much here in way of horror or suspense in fact one line from the film pretty much sums up what to expect mike the girl brother in law has tied her the name is diane by the way and she is played by brinke stevens up after trying to chainsaw her sister he removes gag from her mouth and says something like this won be the last gag we see tonight indeed it was not the special effects are cheesy and poorly crafted and the film makes use of this by playing on its comedic appeal some of the lines and situations are funny robert quarry old count yorga himself really steals his scenes as an irish priest he hams it up wailing biblical verses and crooning irish songs you know you are in trouble however when eddie deezen gets top billing deezen does his schtick and has couple nice moments as well but the material is just too threadbare than to be anything more than teenage sophomoric time filler michael berryman from the hills have eyes also has brief but interesting cameo in the film as for the other thespians well they are all pretty good at being pretty mediocre stevens is lovely in fishnet stockings and french cut panties but beyond that don expect too much more from her her sister is played by elena sahagun and she shows bit more than brinke very lovely young lady by the way and out acts brinke by miles her husband played by jay richardson shows off his ability to act and be funny amidst mediocrity again not bad film to waste little time that involves no thinking on if you are robert quarry fan watch it for his performance at the very least &#39;,
 &#39; wenders was great with million hotel don know how he came up with this film the idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of american society is hopeful that makes it 2 out of ten but this is not movie is that the best someone can do with great idea the west east clash there are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of mac with the fingers of an amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity because she is just ignorant about the facts the characters are not well shaped and the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me at the ending scene lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen and the background music says will pray the thing is not about religion actually but it ends up with this how you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray the lights are already shining on the truth its just that nobody wants to see it ps my home is not place it is people the only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence but it is wasted behind this film making by the way as someone mentioned below americas finest young man are not finest they are just the poor and the hopeless ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government &#39;,
 &#39; whoa in the twin cities we have station that shows big bad movie monday through friday tonight nugget was film with carrie fisher called she back about really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house bea beatrice comes back to haunt her husband she wants him to seek revenge on her killers hence she back and she won let him rest until he does so she irritates him endlessly and the viewers too this movie is truly one of the worst movies ve ever seen hey like bad movies though my fave movie is xanadu was really shaking my head throughout the whole film wondering who thought this would be good idea for movie bea is just so annoying the plot is silly the acting is bad the story well you get my drift anyway if you wanna see really bad movie really really bad movie check this one out you won be disappointed heh &#39;,
 &#39; am surprised so few have good words for this movie for its time the 80 it was very entertaining and engaging story casting was good story was good special effects were remarkable for the time period deserving of an 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this is the worst movie have seen for years it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way thnik when is something going to happen in this film and the the acting is worse the ending lifts it bit and saves the movie from total flop mark wahlberg is bad actor in bad movie sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks &#39;,
 &#39; at risk of sounding slightly sacrilegious on first viewing m kind of inclined to put this right up on par with shaun of the dead now given view simon pegg as an unquestionable comedy genius realise this is rather big claim and to what extent you agree with that last statement may be good preliminary gauge of whether fido will appeal to you br br in way the comedy picks up where shaun left off except we re back in the original 1950s living dead era stereotypical middle american small town the zombie wars are over and zombies themselves are becoming more well adjusted useful members of the community this so we re informed at the outset is largely thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people at zomcom nice play on romantic comedy perhaps br br the beauty of the film lies in its dead pan depiction of respectable neighbourhood maintaining core values while making place for zombies and the special hazards they pose the charm and balance with which it does this is near enough perfect themes you might expect from more mainstream kitsch comedy come through the veneer of good clean living keeping up appearances repressed emotion muddled parental values social decorum and the plight of the alienated individual br br it a story told with happy heart and wide appeal that is brought to life vividly by the film all round strong cast it one of those works where it really shows through that everyone involved got kick out of taking part it also fun imagining what billy connelly learning his script must have been like br br so in conclusion it is probable you will appreciate the humour of this film unless your father tried to eat you &#39;,
 &#39; went to see this film because joaquim de almeida was in it joaquim had fairly small part so it was good that liked the film on it own in fact liked it lot br br the film centers around two characters albert and louie albert is shy retiring sort and louie well louie is not the story revolves around louie request to albert to let him come over to albert place for just little while louie has just gotten out of prison br br albert and louie have known each other since childhood and of course whenver they do something together there is trouble and it albert who always takes the fall br br the action of the film is based on the adventures that ensue from louie visit on the run is chronicle of mad cap zany situations however bruno de almeida and scriptwriter joseph minion after hours don always take you where you expect to go there are twists and turns that add depth to this film of course there is plenty of outright comedy but there is much subtle humor here as well br br there are some downright good performances here as well albert is played delightfully by michael imperioli he getting fairly well knownthese days from the hbo series the sopranos br br louie is played by john ventimiglia who imbues his character with lovable child like quality no matter what he does you just gotta love louie br br both these actors are excellent in their individual characters with imperioli you ll want to hug him and bring him home to mom ventimiglia well you won know whether you should slap him or bring him home and not to mom br br there are other stand out performances as well the character of rita is played by drena deniro yes robert daughter the audience adored her in talking with the others who saw the film it was fun to discuss whether it was albert or louie who was their favorite of those two but everyone loved rita br br is this film perfect no can say that it is there were many times wished the director had had bigger budget to work with there were some scenes that cried out for more budgetary freedom give this guy decent budget to work with and believe you are going to see film that will make you stand up and notice br br the ending sequence was bit of victim of budget yet budget or no budget the ending screen shot in my opinion brought together the talent of actor and director into memorable emotionally effective scene br br &#39;,
 &#39; but had to see just how bad it could get the plotline was thin to begin with but it just kept getting worse female genetic engineering grad student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create male because biological weapon used in ww3 killed off 97 of the worldwide male population the surviving men are either high prices gigolos in back alley clubs or crazed lunatics in run down football stadiums plotting to overthrow the lesbian conspiracy the entire process resembled the microwaving of large bowl of jello press few buttons and ding you get baby not only that but he will age to mid 20 in month and then begin to age normally how convenient eventually poor adam gets bored with the secluded cabin in the woods where his creator had raised him and steals her car to see the city br br this begins 90 minutes of unlikely chases convenient plot twists and several subplots that we never see resolved as adam quickly learns what men did survive are treated as outcasts criminals because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence the propaganda machines have been in full swing scaring women into believing all men are rapists and murderers this has led to lesbianism being the norm the fall of christianity female only reproduction via cloning and oh yeah world peace among other implied results all of which seem unlikely given that only 30 years had elapsed since the war adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next all the while being genetically programmed to be non violent and unable to really do much on his own behalf with the fbi on his trail madams looking for fresh meat and his creator trying to recapture him for herself it seems he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all br br all in all would not recommend this movie br br did however enjoy veronica cartwrights portrayal of the love to hate her director of the fbi and julie bowen didn do bad as hope the closet hetero geneticist either &#39;,
 &#39; dr bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it the thing about him is that he is depressed dr bock and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn doing very good job at healing people he becomes suicidal but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better all around this story is murder mystery and group of angry protesters outside br br the movie is well done and the character of dr bock is well played out it a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of drama it was good to see couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr bock was doing great movie &#39;,
 &#39; ve been playing this movie incessantly this month and just love it was around in the 60s oh dear so it is nostalgic in one sense however it the funny premise the snappy dialogue and the great performances that keep me watching br br dr winston reactions to stephanie at the end of the movie are priceless d be more specific but don want to spoil it for anyone who other than matthau can play man not entirely on the up and up and yet have us still love him as for bergman costumes think she looks as dowdy as she supposed to think she was robbed the one time that she appears in an evening gown it doesn suit her at all which is too bad never liked it when first saw it on her and still don br br goldie won an oscar for her role people thought it was groundbreaking performance at the time and yet it the one performance that don love as much as the others she does have the right amount of sweetness and likability however which is important for this role br br and agree thought rick lenz was great in it and it too bad that his movie career didn take off after this br br hope more people watch this movie they ll love it &#39;,
 &#39; this movie tries to run away to the typical m fighting because m obliged to defend the fatherland the nazi are all bad guys m against them typical of german war movies how by not talking too much about it and just referring the war and the pow nevertheless would like to see german movie which would be something between the extremity of come and see and the bad nazi das boot say this because excluding this factor the german movies are the best depicting 2nd world war and the german side you easily see some of the german hierarchical relations very different from the ones in us army br br this is movie which tries to get real sight of what was stalingrad and was not there and doubt most people were there now but if would choose one movie depicting this battle for sure would not be the all american enemy at the gates why do say this because even the best soldiers are not hero and given the conditions they may regard their own lives instead of the fatherland this goes for all the ranks and in the end you see von paulus giving the example &#39;,
 &#39; went into this film expecting hoping for sleazy drive in style slice of seventies exploitation but what got was more of bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action it clear that this film was made on budget the locations are drab and poorly shot while the acting leaves lot to be desired also the plot focuses on trio of robbers father and two sons that steal load of gold after killing some miners they come across cabin inhabited by young girl and her stepmother and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl currently residing in an asylum it clear that directors louis leahman and william sachs thought they were making something really shocking but despite its best efforts south of hell mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer the film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long winded dialogue the only good thing have to say about the film is with regards to the music which is good in places the ending is the only other good thing about the movie and that only because it the last thing that happens wouldn recommend anyone bothers tracking this down there was much better trash made in the seventies &#39;,
 &#39; looked forward to viewing this film and seeing these great actors perform however was sadly disappointed in the script and the entire plot of the story david duchovny dr eugene sands connie carla 04 was the doctor in the story who uses drugs and losses his license to practice medicine dr sands was visiting night club and was able to use his medical experience to help wounded customer and was assisted by angelina jolie claire taking lives 04 who immediately becomes attracted to dr david sands timothy hutton raymond blossom kinsey 04 plays the big shot gangster and man with all kinds of money and connections timothy hutton seems to over act in most of the scenes and goes completely out of his mind trying to keep his gang members from being killed gary dourdan yates csi vegas tv series plays great supporting role and portrays real cool dude who is so called body guard for raymond blossom angelina jolie looks beautiful and sexy with her ruby red lips which draws great deal of attention from all the men this film is not the greatest but it does entertain &#39;,
 &#39; this was one of the worst films can remember seeing am sure have seen worse though if that mitigates me slamming it br br the humor isn funny there are stupid stereotype jokes that again aren funny was captive audience on plane and viewed this film it was complete waste of time enjoyed martin in earlier films but not this one same for queen latifah she was excellent in chicago and in set it off she was good too but this role was horrid br br mostly credit the failure to the bad writing of the script feel strongly you can save formulaic unfunny script with decent actors this movie as case in point still all involved should have been wise enough to not participate in this film am just amazed that something so bad can get greenlighted made released theatrically and promoted &#39;,
 &#39; first of all let us discuss about the story it is copy of the movie hitch with an added indian flavor to it one guy who is love guru and another man who is seemingly sucker when it comes to ladies and how this seemingly sucker becomes charmer with the help of the love guru forms the story salman khan is the love guru and govinda is the lame guy br br now coming to artists performance salman khan overacts throughout the movie he tries to be funny but fails big time you can see salman shouting throughout the movie no real acting is seen in his performance govinda pairs opposite katrina kaif oh my god she is one heck of girl real beauty is in real life 50 year old dude and katrina is girl in her early twenties in the movie govinda looks like grandpa of katrina kaif what pity coming to execution of the movie this movie feels like b movie and poor imitation of the movie hitch where hitch looks like movie with purpose and depth this movie is shallow and purposeless nowhere there is justification or clarity br br just forget this movie for it is nothing but boring typical bollywood fare actually give 3 10 because this is the lowest go &#39;,
 &#39; try to catch this film each time it shown on tv which happily is quite often but keep forgetting to video it as it is practically know the script by heart but that doesn stop me having good cry in fact it probably adds to it as cry knowing what coming next it such lovely film well made well cast good photography love it one of my top ten films &#39;,
 &#39; got to know ã on back in the early 90s via television and loved it br br what did you like about it the cranky drawing style the flawless artistic action involved the absurd and deadpan communication between the characters the whole layout of the surrounding future world no matter what you loved about it br br the aeon flux film of late 2005 has nothing of that br br karyn kusama the so called director of the film was hopelessly over strained with transporting the original content to new film if you re not familiar with the original series you won understand anything during for the first 60minutes of the film the story is inscrutable and the vapid characters do not develop during the film br br kusama attempt to improve the storyline by implementing some rather weak explanatory conversations between the main characters is not only lame attempt to cover up her flaws as storyteller it simply unworthy of the original ã on concept br br charlize theron might be an attractive woman but she can impersonate the ã on character although she was attached to strings doing action scenes her lack of talent for physical motion simply ruins the action sequences in the film the result is tremendous amount of hectic picture cuts to cover up the sheer lameness of her physique br br forget about all the rest it not worth talking about br br give 1point for ms theron showing her boobs and 1point for the nice architectural photography in the film that it &#39;,
 &#39; didn expect much when rented this movie and it blew me away if you like good drama good character development that draws you into character and makes you care about them you ll love this movie br br engrossing &#39;,
 &#39; this off beat horror movie seems to be getting nothing but bad reviews my question is why think this movie is pretty good dee snider did very well for his first and only time directing he also plays the antagonist captain howdy carelton hendriks this movie seems to have view of the future although it came out back in 1998 it seems to be about modern issues internet predators seems to be the underlying plot here although taken to another level this is an issue which we still face today ll admit the story fell short few times but that doesn make this bad movie at all robert englund is even in this movie that automatically makes it better the acting wasn bad the characters were pretty good as well hendriks was pretty good antagonist think give this off beat horror 7 10 recommend for fans of saw &#39;,
 &#39; the movie was good really the only reason watched it was alan rickman which he didn pull off the southern accent but he did pretty well with it know emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad another thing have notice have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 0 clock shadow which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie would give the movie 9 out of 10 another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasn any sex still it was alright love the scene were he says aw sh when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror &#39;,
 &#39; bought this adaptation because really liked anne brontã novel when read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy bbc dramas but m very disappointed never thought it would be as bad as that the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had br br first of all the music and songs seems totally out of place in period drama sounds as if it been written for contemporary horror film and like another commentator was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors ve seen some scenes filmed that way in north and south and it seemed all right there but in the tenant it definitely overdone and simply annoying camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively br br most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity none of the characters were properly introduced at first the little boy gave very good performance he very cute and the best feature of the film br br spoilers tara fitzgerald characterisation of helen graham made her appear cold and harsh letting no emotion pass through she doesn seem to be able to cry at all in realistic way just couldn believe markham could have fell for her and m not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband fancy being married to such virago besides he was the only main actor that sounded right to me toby stephens found just ok helen graham brother not very good br br maybe it difficult to adapt novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty besides what is only hinted at and left to the reader imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the tv adaptation making some scenes both gross and comic like when huntingdon eye starts bleeding and others far too sexed up for period drama mean don we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas &#39;,
 &#39; the gate to hell has opened up under moscow priest played by vincent gallo goes to the city to find friend who has gone missing in the tunnels under the city in an attempt to find the gateway wandering around underground he and his colleagues have to deal with the tunnels inhabitants both human and demonic good idea with good cast of second tier actors goes nowhere much like the tunnels that are its setting ve watched this twice now and still have no idea why this is suppose to be scary when not heck of lot happens other then people talk about the evil and we see shadow forms nothing is clear and honestly didn see the point of it all other than provide pay check for those involved second billed val kilmer is in couple of fleeting scenes that don amount to much other than to allow him to be billed as in the film the idea is really good the performances are fine the script goes nowhere take the advice of several of the characters in the film and don cross the river to see this &#39;,
 &#39; warning spoiler have to agree with you it was almost there this was such bad movie about such and interesting true story it had such promise but the acting was ridiculous at best some sets were beautiful and realistic others are something out of theme park found myself laughing as watched what was suppose to be serious scenes really wanted to like this movie but couldn the best part was the fight between friends that ended with the king dying liked the queens punishment and the final shot made beautiful picture though there are so many better movies to watch don recommend this &#39;,
 &#39; and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice bouncy jugs running around the so called african jungle so no problems there for most males out there br br watched it as one of those bundled together package forget about the plot which is essentially just flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible just to give you sense our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles again no complaints br br the fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic our heroine got caught by the baddies at least five times in the movie on occasions when she has to fight the fighting involves rolling around in the dirt grunting unconvincingly and basically fighting like kittens am surprised no hair pulling is involved it get so bad that the chief baddie had to remind the combatants that said the one that draw first blood wins in order to avoid watching anymore stupid fighting br br the witch doctor kuku was bloody blast from being big cuddly bear in the beginning he became manic depressive when captured and then outright psycho he spent the whole movie muttering lines with no irrelevance br br beside liana our heroine bouncing around topless you also get to see plenty of other amazonians as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take swim for no good reasons yeah it is that kind of movie br br watch the beautiful liane in her bouncy glory despite the movie being more than 20 years old the allure of watching blond women flashing their nice jugs on screen never gets old &#39;,
 &#39; this movie which just discovered at the video store has apparently sit around for couple of years without distributor it easy to see why the story of two friends living in new york searching for their pal from high school who is now living homeless under the boardwalk at coney island has flashes of being very good film but ultimately is weighted down by the story focusing on stan and daniel rather than on their homeless friend richie cryer is as usual very good and the film has nice stark look to it with the ghostly images of coney island however writer cryer and director richard schenkman are too busy dealing with the fairly uninteresting lives of stan and daniel rather than focusing on richie one flashback in music store where richie has crush on an employee stands out and really shows the viewer where this film could have gone but in the end not much two many drawn out scenes of annoyance such as inside the skeeball building rating 4 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; how viewers react to this new adaption of shirley jackson book which was promoted as not being remake of the original 1963 movie true enough will be based suspect on the following those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one and those who have never been exposed to either and who are big fans of hollywood current trend towards special effects being the first and last word in how good film is are going to love it br br things did not like about this adaption br br 1 it was not true adaption of the book from the articles had read this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to and that seemed reasonable no film can cover book word for word unless it is the length of the stand and not even then but there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at in the movie reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining didn like that either what the movie press release should have said is we got the basic very basic idea from shirley jackson book we kept the same names of the house and several though not all of the leading character names but then we decided to write our own story and what the heck we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first and decided to throw in bit of them too br br 2 they completely lost the theme of parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts to investigate house that truly seemed to have been born bad no instead this doctor got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their insomnia he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear like lab rats who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment nice guy this doctor who did not have the same name by the way was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day br br 3 in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies some houses are just born bad this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there and this time around nel gets to unravel the mystery shades of the changeling the only problem was the so called mystery was so incoherently told that m sure it remained mystery to most of the audience but then there was no mystery in the first place not in the book because the house was bad to begin with it first victim died before ever setting eyes on it br br 4 the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous he was supposed to be debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house and was true skeptic of it history and in this one he was just winey voiced bumbling nerd who couldn sleep insomnia remember and was compulsive liar br br 5 was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word the scene with nel sister family and mrs dudley little opening speech to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting it like it couldn make up its mind what it wanted to do br br 6 missed nel narrative through the whole movie the original was so like gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person through nel eyes and we always were privy to her thoughts that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version they also tried to make nel much more of heroine the original nel was not bad person but she was bitter person could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to selfish old woman and spiteful sister and she liked to moan and she lost her temper this one was almost too good to be true this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer had obviously been watching ghost one too many times br br 7 they changed the history of the house and it occupents too much there was no abigail crain the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions there was no companion and there was no nursery there was also no grace wife of the original doctor and hugh crain wives died in totally different ways these changes changed the story way too much don know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should be sorry if ya get my drift the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with br br in conclusion let me just leave you with some words from the original luke appropriate substitution of the word house for movie this movie should be burnt to the ground and the ground sprinkled with salt my favorite movie of all time remains so no competition from this one &#39;,
 &#39; as fan of wm faulkner since college was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons my grandfather also named clarence brown as was the director grew up in the oxford area having been born near there in 1888 we attended week long family reunion at oxford in july 1964 mere 15 years after filming the movie it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru period of civil rights upheaval then as the site of ole miss my recollection is of its being nice little college town that summer but was just an 18 year old college sophomore and white was just then beginning to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice but still had long way to go anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk tight rope to get it done there and would love to know more about that story br br now days oxford is larger more modern college town with all the ills that go along with such things and hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years juano hernandez should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to bigoted itself to let that happen other faulkner stories have been filmed so look for them and compare one of the best was pbs treatment of the barn burner from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that faulkner wrote so incisively about so often &#39;,
 &#39; great suspense movie with terrific slow camera work adding to the dramatics makes this treat to watch and enjoy director writer brian de palma does super hitchcock imitation many called it ripoff with this film and the 2 35 1 widescreen dvd is must to fully appreciate the camera work and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted for tv tapes br br the downside of the movie at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard is the general sleaziness of all the characters including the policeman played by pre nypd dennis franz who has hair here br br the opening scene is still shocking with fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit even 25 years after its release the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson if that is really her on the closeups and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies br br there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it apparent who the killer is it still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through particularly for males ogling the naked women &#39;,

 &#39; walt disney 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself he died in late 1966 and is not generally considered to be among their very best output the main problem is that on the surface the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp 1955 or 101 dalmations 1961 both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so being both an animation and cat lover dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which pampered female cat voiced by eva gabor and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by wealthy lady hermione baddeley greedy butler luckily they meet streetwise alley cat phil harris who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by feline jazz band led by scatman crothers and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs meanwhile at home edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song which includes verse in french and scatman band indulge in breezy number ev rybody wants to be cat &#39;,

 &#39; some unsuspecting films carry message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing such is the case for carol journey el viaje de carol beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel boca de noche by ã x81ngel garcã xada roldã who also adapted the book as screenplay war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films but when that war theme plays in the background as subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults the result is different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre br br carol clara lago is 12 year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora marã xada barranco returns to her aurora home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio ã x81lvaro de luna since his wife death carol father robert ben temple is fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family aurora has past she left her lover alfonso alberto jimã nez to marry robert and alfonso in turn married aurora cold sister dolores lucina gil carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her class tomiche juan josã ballesta and his two friends at first resent carol but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love when aurora dies of her illness carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca luna mcgill yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother best friend and teacher maruja the always radiant rosa maria sardã xa0 to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side through series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults facing more traumas in brief period of the war than most of us experience in lifetime the ending though sad is uplifting as carol journey to maturity is complete br br the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizã bal director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josã ballesta but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles this is visually stunning work with lasting message and should find much larger audience than it has to this date grady harp &#39;,
 &#39; the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day lewis and hugh conor as christy brown guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds as person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing the enormous support that christy got form his family low income working class dubliners encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown witty arrogant personality do recommend this movie to everyone especially to classic movie lovers &#39;,
 &#39; buy or at least watch every seagall movie he came out with handful of good movies then descending into poor stories bad camera work and walk thru persona he nearly lost me few movies ago he remembered how to make decent movie now he forgotten again this film is seriously dark on any level you care to name there is lot of slash gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it meant as warning against the military br br seagall may have had stand in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else voice was used most of the time sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with prisoner anyway this bad guy was at least colorful and very focused there lots of gore if you like that king of thing it looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time m just glad they didn suck the blood from their hapless victims harken you back to my summary basically it is horror movie disguised as an action film dec 6 2006 &#39;,
 &#39; saw this film as kid about 30 years ago and haven forgotten it to this day couldn say whether it a good picture but in those days instantly fell in love with jean simmons the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but still remember the plot simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling david lean great expectations and again it was the young jean simmons it a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video d like to correct my memories &#39;,
 &#39; feels like an impressionistic film if there is such thing br br the story is well told very poetic the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters or interpreted by the actors br br the film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well unless you hate such emotion in movies not so in my case br br it a very humanistic film br br the landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right br br well done br br good classic for any good film collection &#39;,
 &#39; san francisco is big city with great acting credits in this one the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city they didn even manage the most basic of realistic details so would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being san francisco movie you will not be thinking oh ve been there you will be thinking how did two story firetrap stinky armpit turn into quiet hotel lobby some of the leads used east coast speech styles and affectations it detracts but the acting was always competent br br the stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles at least in the beginning the chinatown story was the most effective and interesting the plot is weak ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies the originals had lot more tension and emotional resonance they were framed and paced better but the acting is fun and we get to see james hong and other luminaries br br the white boy intro was pointless think the filmmakers didn know what to do with it so they left it loosely structured and cut it down the father is an odd attempt at berkeley liberal really folks everyone knows it not groovy to live in the ghetto but his segments are the most humorous they threw away some good opportunities educated and embittered on the west coast yuppie jerk here is different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in new york they are equally intolerable but always distinguishable that would have been interesting this was not br br the hunter point intro was the most disappointing it was the most derivative of the three and stylistically the most distant from san francisco you ve seen it done before and you ve seen it done better even the video game was better br br despite the generic non locality and aimless script these characters have potential the actors have talent and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction about ten minutes before the ending good concept placed in the wrong hands br br ps there is missing minority here see if you can guess which one &#39;,
 &#39; hated it with all my being worst movie ever mentally scarred help me it was that bad trust me &#39;,

 &#39; okay people have to agree with almost everyone else reviews here the characters are stupid they re all stereotypical and yet have nice clothes and are always skinny br br don even get me started on jamie lynn role as zoey zoey is pretty popular tan blonde young teen who everyone just loves she has rebellious great personality that everyone agrees with no matter how dumb or extreme it is most annoying of all her voice is so darn bubbly and obnoxious omg br br take for example the first episode the moment she steps onto the huge pca campus everyone seems to love her the boys want to ask her out the girls want to be her friend etc thinking she all that the episode plays out with zoey always being the center of attention she is the so called best player of the unofficial girls basketball team confident and has everyone pity her when she weakly gets hit in the face oh boo hoo br br my favorite character by far is this whole series is girl that appears much later into the show lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced in the show to hate zoey br br and zoey doesn even seem to be very loyal to her friends sometimes in one episodes she even calls her friend freak without ever apologizing and doesn show the least bit regret in doing so br br zoey is always the best br br desiging professional shirts and backpacks which become big hit br br coming up with very elaborate schemes by herself to teach single person lesson br br flawless grades br br taking the blame for stuff that wasn even related to her just so everyone else could be happy br br coming up with commercial that was so good it was put on tv the list goes on and on br br ugh she has no acting talent she always the perfect person she acts snotty and rebellious and preppy and ugh can stand her br br not only that but everyone in the show always has great clothes even the nerd her wardrobe is better than mine and mine is pretty freaking decent br br no one cares if everyone at pca loves you zoey and would do anything for you even if it meant giving their right arm br br but regardless of these cardboard characters the plots are creative not everyday things they re interesting and amusing the humor is usually good natured and fun but the characters are so paper flat that it hard to enjoy it br br this show would be really good if dan schnieder put bit more time thinking of the type of characters he wanted because they are so typical so boring that it lame and stupid br br point no one the least bit overweight everyone has stylish clothes zoey is the definition of mary sue the story lines are well thought out and the humor is laughable but again want to emphasize that the characters taint the show watch the show if you must but don say didn warn you if your eyes start to bleed &#39;,

 &#39; can name only few movies that have seen which were this bad this movie has terrible everything the dialog is corny and clichã the acting is poor for the most part with few exceptions the cinematography is nothing to cheer about and the plot is silly fat woman stalks suburban family because her daughter didn make the soccer team this is so bad it funny to watch if you can catch this on lifetime d recommend it highly as comedy as for being serious movie m afraid ll have to rate this 2 br br don watch this film if you are serious movie fan and looking for an interesting and challenging storyline or good acting there is none to be found br br edit hmmm think group of people who work for lifetime must have written some phony reviews and voted all the negative ones down don believe them this is really crappy movie &#39;,
 &#39; got this thing off the sci fi shelf because remembered seeing the first of the series when was kid d rented the second one and it was decent sci fi this one was out right obnoxious the special effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done the two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that literally cringed every time they came on the screen the plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick don know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be part of this movie but m sure that they have done better to have left it at 2 movies the movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device &#39;,
 &#39; good evil film with tastes of james bond romeo and juliet and maybe even star wars br br the evil count von bruno receives an english gentleman as guest for very dangerous hunt elga the beautiful simple and well intentioned lady that was forced to marry the count provides the love triangle the count missing eye points to terrible past the englishman is not what the count thinks and is terrible treat to him there is also the terrible hunchback crocodiles and even the side appearance of some torture instruments br br boris karlloff here in support role makes an strong but somewhat stiff presence the other actors and direction are the symbol of an era the strong representations of black and white movies since the beginning there is no doubt of who is the evil guy who is the good one even traitors and stiffs can be identified somewhat easily &#39;,
 &#39; there is scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst have seen in some time as scott fitzgerald gregory peck and sheilah graham deborah kerr are lounging on the beach suddenly things become tense and sheilah begins to cry at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past this dramatic scene becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic couldn help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to phony crescendo no one experiences moments like this no one now how much of the rest of the film is true cannot say but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an 8 rolex and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct the film is lot of bunk however am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet didn seem to clear this up either br br just who were scott fitzgerald and sheilah graham and what was their relationship really like what do know about fitzgerald however does seem different from what saw in the film was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film well considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with graham and drank like fish d assume he wasn was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film perhaps but if he was this bad and yet ms graham stayed with him then this makes her out to be complete dummy and not someone you like to see featured in film and if he wasn then the film does poor disservice to his memory either way it made for painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience br br the sum total of this film appears to be tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people in dark and salacious way some might find this all very entertaining but most are sure to see this as train wreck with no surprises along the way unpleasant but with glossy production values especially the music which was lovely but way over the top it begs the question why did they even choose to make this in the first place the bottom line it a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time even if like me you are big gregory peck fan &#39;,
 &#39; independent film that would make hollywood proud the movie substitutes good looks for good acting cryptic plot for good story line and self absorption for character development may be missed something go see it for yourself &#39;,
 &#39; despite all the hoopla about the trouble with tribbles episode the balance of terror might just be the best episode of the series and while have always loved piece of the action because it is so much fun really do have to cast my vote as this romulan episode as being the very best br br the movie interestingly enough is really like wwii submarine movie in that it bounces back and forth between the cloaked romulan ship and the enterprise as it seeks to destroy the romulans before they sneak back across the neutral zone after raid on federation outposts in so many ways the show is much like the film the enemy below where the american captain robert mitchum and the german captain curt jurgens are shown in counter point as they both try to outwit the other and in the process develop grudging respect for their foe br br interestingly enough only short bit of the beginning of the episode takes place on planet and this is amazing because an episode on board ship could easily have been static and dull but because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters written and acted so well shatner and mark leonard as the romulan leader oddly for the die hard trekkers out there they ll recognize leonard as the same actor who later played spock father br br the bottom line is this is simply great and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat &#39;,

 &#39; to review this movie without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino pulp fiction 1994 when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for living jules tells vincent that the only thing she did worthwhile was pilot vincent asks what the hell is pilot and jules goes into very well description of what tv pilot is well the way they make shows is they make one show that show called pilot then they show that show to the people who make shows and on the strength of that one show they decide if they re going to make more shows some pilots get picked and become television programs some don become nothing she starred in one of the ones that became nothing now to stretch on what jules was talking about there are billions of television shows pilots that were never aired because they simply were not well good probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is a t r spin off to a h with gary radar burghoff as the lead hmmm would somebody really want to be watching radar for half hour trying to solve crimes hence the show was never picked up what many people don know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide some have made they re way past and got onto the air the pilot for the animated series american dad comes to mind as the show serial itself didn begin until nearly four months later however there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air and this here is why br br black bart supposed tie in with the mel brooks comedy classic blazing saddles is stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul saddles was controversial comedy nevertheless with it racist humor and vulgar comedy which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make great television show for prime time tv say supposed because none of the memorable characters from the movie aside from bart on in this mess of tv show mel brooks wasn even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in long line in related story recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for series based on the movie clerks that kevin smith was no involved in you see what happens br br set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west named appropriately black bart who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr obviously before his stint in real acting whereas in this he is playing g rated richard pryor most of the other characters are carbon if not really bad copies of the characters in the movie jim the waco kid is replaced by similar looking character named reb jordan former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer more of ripoff of the character being that she a show dancer and german with marlene dietrich type accent and personality while that pretty much the end in similarities the lead bad guy in the story is fern malaga played by noble willingham who assumed would ve been hedley lamar if warner bros secured the rights to the name see trivia for blazing saddles and his son curley dunno taggart suppose the story is poor excuse for sitcom much less pilot bart deals with the mayor drunk son and he out of control behavior which has caused the town to spin really it a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesn focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show can really call it sitcom and even if wanted to and that primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros studios and later added laugh track so the show is set up almost exactly like a h complete with bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series the acting is so so but there one part that always make me laugh and that when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out piece of dialogue ha the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie surprisingly they use the word er numerous amount of times through 22 minute episode rather touchy for it time period and even for today and it gets repetitive br br if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss surly interesting novelty item watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots it on the collector edition of blazing saddles god knows why there yourself get first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie in pilots never air &#39;,
 &#39; oy vey jurrasic park got corman ized as usual the plot is wafer thin from 1 foot tall dinosaurs that weigh 150 pounds and leave tracks bigger than they are to inexplicable science which uses lasers to keep the dinosaurs in check and poultry trucks which have chickens loose in cages large enough for big dogs ve seen chicken trucks they are all in cages the size of shoe boxes and all that is in the first 15 minutes of this disaster of film all the male actors are imbeciles thinking grizzly might be loose in the desert constantly dropping items to give the raptor an easy kill and the female actors all look like they just came from modeling shoot for fredrick of hollywood the raptor itself is the worst thing since the hobgoblins from the movie of the same name it looks like they had hand puppet version and plastic model for the motion shots if you want good movie to sit around and heckle mst3k style this is gold if you want competent film making and good acting don watch roger corman film acting gets 4 out 10 some of the players upon this stage did try story gets 2 out of 10 it reads like drunken storytelling session gone bad special effects gets 2 out of 10 ve seen worse but not many &#39;,
 &#39; in his first go as hollywood director henry brommell whips an enthralling yarn that is all of penetrating relatable marital issues with melancholic authenticity and lacing such with an equally absorbing subplot of father son hit man business the film is directed astutely and consists of wonderfully put together cast as well as swift family conscious screenplay also by brommell that brings life to an otherwise fatigued genre as bonus panic delivers subtle acerbic humorâ an unexpected undeniably charming and very welcome surpriseâ through its bumbling unsure of himself low key star whose ever cool state is enticing especially given his line of work br br the forever great william macy again captures our hearts as alex unhappy torn middle aged husband and father who finds solace in the most dubious of persons young attractive equally messed up 23 year old named sarah neve campbell whom he meets in the waiting room at psychologist office where he awaits the therapy of dr josh parks john ritter to discuss his growing eagerness to quit the family business that his father donald sutherland built alex whose lust to lead new life is obstructed by the fear of disappointing his dictating father strikes an unwise fancy for sarah which ultimately leads him to understand the essence and irrefutable responsibility of being husband to his wife and more importantly to him good father to his six year old son sammy played enthusiastically by the endearing david dorfman br br henry brommell brilliant panic is something of rarity in hollywood seldom seen with the exception of 2002 road to perdition since its conception in 2000â it weaves two conflicting genres organized crime family drama into fascinating warm hunk of movie viewing that is evenly strong in either directionâ and it one that will maintain its exceptional infrequent caliber and gleaming sincerity for ages to come &#39;,
 &#39; after perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers there are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent they know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of gifted author for many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre pubescent teenagers today well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors asimov heinlein bradbury and ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement in doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition this well informed fans are critical of anything hollywood throws at them they are not critical for it own sake but look upon each offering with skeptical eye as they should as hollywood record has been less than stellar to these fans the story must take supreme importance they cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences when the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest br br the second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre look at many of the above comments that state well haven read the book or anything by this author their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel they are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects they are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie case in point robot while supposedly based on asimov short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations those of you that will run out and buy robot will be very much surprised this movie isn even based on that story at all br br the film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity won point them out won spoon feed you you need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself the characters which are named after many of asimov characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was hallmark of his stories the plot itself with all it action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for his belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future in short other than the name their is very little of isaac in anything about this movie there will always be those uncritical e unthinking who will state the movie doesn have to be like the book due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made but what about case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start what if all they took from the written work was the title this begs the question why tarnish great body of work by slapping it title on your vacuous piece of crap save money and don buy the rights to the works title it something else don use the character names believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism in fact it won matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him but it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them pretty light show br br robot like much of hollywood take on the genre pushes science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago hollywood could not do this alone it takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this &#39;,
 &#39; what like about you is definitely show that couldn wait to see each day amanda bynes is such an excellent actress and grew up watching her show the amanda show she a very funny person and seems to be down to earth holly is such like able person and has an out there personality enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down so she messed herself up at times but that what made the show so great br br especially loved the show when the character vince came along nick zano is very hot and funny as well as gary wesley jonathan the whole cast was great each character had their own personality and charm jennie garth allison munn and leslie grossman were all very interesting especially loved lauren she the best she helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she gonna do or say next overall the show is really nice but the reason didn give it 10 was because there no more new episodes and because the episodes could ve been longer and more deep &#39;,
 &#39; the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly i ll take you there is not overt but clearly has ties to his work shelly has acted in two of hartley films not only does her film exhibit very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in very real light though this film is not ironic on the whole thank god the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss with beautiful cinematography and soundtrack straight from the seventies ll see you there is great indie film that doesn stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion br br the film begins with bill life falling to pieces not only has he sold his best friend ray beautiful country home but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat all washed up bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy played by the director adrienne shelly brings him all kinds of surprises self help book and date for her traumatized brother br br the unwilling bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice no doubt bernice initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her however her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him to what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy br br aware that bill desperately wants to see rose bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first on the way she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun pinkerton detective no less an imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose of course with few stops along the way &#39;,
 &#39; when in 1982 the thing came out to theaters everywhere it had cold reception and very poor box office results becoming almost failure in john carpenter career as horror director however time has proved that the thing was definitely not failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the film fault nowadays john carpenter the thing has gained the appreciation it rightfully deserves and is considered by many horror fans as horror classic and not without reason as this new version of john campbell jr story who goes there previously adapted as the thing from another world is closer to the original tale and keeps pessimistic feeling of dread and high doses of suspense in masterfully crafted study about paranoia br br the plot of the thing begins in the winter of 1982 in u research station located in the remote territories of antarctica when the members of the crew notice norwegian helicopter coming their way the two apparently insane pilots of the helicopter are trying to kill husky dog who makes its way into the american base after the norwegians are killed accidentally the americans try to figure out what made them to be insane soon they ll discover that the husky dog the norwegians were hunting was not normal dog but creature able to mimic every living creature and not only that it has tremendous hunger br br director john carpenter earned place in history when in 1978 he directed the seminal slasher halloween where suspense and atmosphere were above gore and shock the thing could be seen as an evolution of that style as even when carpenter makes great use of rob bottin special effects which were labeled by critics as repulsive on its day the film still focuses more on atmosphere and suspense rather than in the violent and very well done displays of gore the feeling of loneliness as well as the bad karma between the members of the crew increase the feeling of paranoia as anyone could be the thing even our main character j macready kurt russell ending in situation where nobody can be trusted br br this plot element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel and was blatantly ignored by the previous version not completely bad thing just big difference making this version feel less like remake and more as new conception of the source novel bill lancaster script handles the characters with brilliant domain giving us enough to distinguish them but not too much to completely trust them making them an essential factor in the film haunting feeling of dread that keeps running through the movie the mystery and the suspense are at the max as never one can tell who is the thing and who is normal enhancing the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results br br the cast is very effective and their performances as whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters as real carpenter regular collaborator kurt russell as macready carries the film and through his eyes we witness the madness and the horror the research station becomes as the situations goes worse definitely one of his best performances wilford brimley is also terrific as dr blair scientist that goes insane after discovering the thing purposes br br the thing is film so wonderfully crafted that its flaws tend to go unnoticed although they exist the most notorious being the very low key and at times unappropriated score by ennio morricone it not exactly bad but it just feels out of place at some scenes and it not one of the best works by the legendary composer also due to some misshapes with the special effects some scenes were left out that actually fill some small plot holes although nothing of big importance or actually annoying br br when talking about john carpenter films most people will almost instantly name halloween as his favorite film but personally would go with the thing as consider it carpenter greatest achievement so far and one of the most interesting and actually scary horror films ever made would go as far as to call it one of the finest films ever made 10 10 &#39;,

 &#39; about your terrible movie copying beethoven as professional musician it my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and beethoven is one of my favorites when hungarians and americans meet it a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible you proved it in your terrible movie the only thing that carries the movie is the music of course you didn bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the tackacs quartet but ok have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you ve made it starts of with the dying deaf beethoven who perfectly understands anna who is merely whispering beethoven hearing during the movie get better by the minute but that must be because of some vague divine thing then there is the quite impossible semi pornographic eyes wide shut double conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious anna and the crying nephew in the end who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes my god what performance and as culmination the rip off from amadeus with beethoven dictating music to anna not in notes but in total nonsense which she understands perfectly but no one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand of course your reaction will be that negative response is response at least but can assure you that beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason this so called homage is blasphemy and am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it about my favorite subject ed harris and others you cannot comprehend the greatness of beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing that the trouble with you americans you think you can grasp everything even when it takes lifetime of hard work yeah we can do it anyway remember that good product comes with hard labor talent devotion and professionalism all these you creators of copying beethoven lack see you in kindergarten &#39;,
 &#39; samuel fuller is hardly one of america great directors m not sure he qualifies as one of hollywood great craftsmen but he certainly ranks up there with the best of hollywood true professionals who were willing to march to their own music during the time he worked for hollywood studios he knew how to take an assignment shape the middling material handed to him and then turn it quickly and efficiently into something usually better than its parts on time and on budget pickup on south street is case in point on the surface it one more of hollywood early fifties anti commie movies complete with appeals to patriotism hard boiled hero and slimy and copiously perspiring bad guy fuller turns this bag of hollywood clichã into taut exciting drama with any number of off kilter twists the hero skip mccoy is three time loser petty crook with soft fingers who doesn change his stripes until the very end the girl in the caper candy has level of virtue that would be easy to step over if you re so inclined one of the most appealing characters moe williams is stoolie and in an unusual approach to hollywood battle against commies the appeals to patriotism fall on deaf ears the hero isn motivated by anything so ennobling he just wants payback for personal reason and winds up becoming at least for now good guy br br plus all the actors were mostly assigned to fuller by the studio he had to make do richard widmark by now had established his presence as an actor and star but jean peters is surprise she gives fine portrait of woman sexy and dumb and no better than her boy friends or her clients want her to be and richard kiley who later would become two time tony award winning star on broadway is convincingly slippery and cowardly it hard to remember that he was the actor who inflicted on us mean introduced to us the impossible dream from man of la mancha br br more than anything else this tale of pickpocket who picks purse in subway car and finds himself with microfilmed secrets instead of cash pursued by the feds and the commies moves straight ahead with great economy the whole enterprise with classic noir look only takes 80 minutes to tell the dialogue with fuller as screenwriter has that party corny partly pungent hard boiled pulp fiction style that muffin you grifted she okay one character says to skip about candy fuller moves us just fast enough from scene to scene to keep us hanging on what will come next then fuller throws in the character of moe williams all of sudden the story ratchets up to whole new level of interest part comedy relief and part sad inevitability br br the thing like best about the movie is how the opening exemplifies fuller talents and strengths in 2 minutes and 15 seconds starting right after the credits fuller is able to instantly power up the movie to establish for us what the story is about and to show us what kind of characters skip and candy we re going to be involved with and he does this with so much enticing curiosity in that hot packed subway car that we can just about feel fuller setting the hook to catch us br br says glenn erickson in my opinion one of the best of movie critics in what should be an inconsequential story sam fuller defines his peculiar view of americanism from the bottom up stiff necked aggressive self interest that when fully expressed recognizes what wrong and what right and isn afraid to fight for it as always in his work the individuals who fight the hardest for their country are the ones least likely to benefit from the effort he right and it makes for movie still vivid after 55 years &#39;,

 &#39; often feel like scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or write the review to balance unwarranted raves found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast forwarding not only through dull clichã dialog but even dull clichã musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development individually june haver and dan dailey appear to be nice people but can carry movie as team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they re both bland like billy gray but his character is pretty one note the best part of the film to me are june haver beautiful costumes and great body &#39;,
 &#39; recap full moon creature huge werewolf is on the hunt not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take bite on the way though but for mate he is on the hunt for girl not any girl though the girl the girl that is pure and also werewolf although she doesn know it yet three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating lot of folks around full moon is werewolf this particular powerful werewolf darkwolf is closing in on the girl if he gets her mankind is doomed now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is werewolf herself and then they got to stop him br br comments this is one for the boys the teenage boys lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot mostly less well guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin and unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking one usually turns to two main themes nudity check and then special effects hmm well there are some things that you might call effects they re not very special though in fact to be blunt they are very bad the movie seems to be suffering of lack of funds they couldn afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap some of the transformations between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad you might overlook such things but the darkwolf in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings just some mutilated corpses afterwards and there is surprisingly little blood about in movie that honestly should be drenched in blood br br m not sure what to say about actors and characters most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above like the poor effects or the poor budget that could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving but hey when you re in real danger there nothing that will save your life like good one liner br br unfortunately that can explain moments when the cop steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her but sure it let the makers stretch the ending little more br br but wouldn mind seeing none of the lead actors actresses get another try in another movie br br well to give small conclusion not movie that recommend br br 3 10 &#39;,
 &#39; first heard about the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya from reviewer on youtube he literally slapped the show with big bad rant condemning it rubbish and confusing curious decided to watch the show once got the order of the episodes right thanks to those who made the lists and found it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely lovable and hilarious unique and not over blowing plot that makes sense now that ve watched the show and two of the best anime moments in history in my opinion plus the opening and ending themes are great br br the anime based on collection of successful manga novels follows simple plot once you understand it while the show focus is on the main character haruhi suzumiya the point of view is from her friend kyon kyon is regular high school student who doesn really believe in supernatural stuff g santa clause aliens time travellers ghosts espers but he soon ends up talking to haruhi who is the most oddest girl in the school and would prefer to date an alien considering all men worthless she even joined every club in the school to find something interesting but quit as quickly as she joined upon advice from kyon haruhi decides to form her own club with kyon club setting up in the literary club room haruhi forms the sos brigade its mission to investigate supernatural cases think scooby doo minus the dog the masked man and the mystery machine br br haruhi recruits three extra members the first is yuki nagato bookworm of sorts who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting the second is mikuru asahina shy girl who is forced into the club by haruhi who thinks they need cute mascot to get some things done she is often forced into costumes by haruhi to further her cuteness the third is itsuki koizumi friendly and sociable transfer student who is always smiling while haruhi thinks her group is filled with normal people she couldn be more wrong while kyon is as normal as you can get the other three on the other hand are rather unique yuki is an alien mikuru is time traveller from the future and itsuki is an esper person who has esp all three have come to watch over haruhi who may just have the powers of god and if she becomes bored she may be able to discover her powers and create whole new world and kyon is involved somehow br br the show is worth watching with great characters music and some hilarious and wonderful moments however for parents there is some sexual references including mikuru cleavage being exposed or touched several times and several swear words used as well apart from that the show is one of the greats &#39;,

 &#39; waited until the 4th of july to write this because well because it just feels right to be doing it on this day br br in 1924 w griffith needed hit he had not had big one since orphans of the storm 1921 he been working steadily since then but his movies had been smaller in scope and had failed to hit the right chord with audiences he was planning film about patrick henry when he was contacted by members of the daughters of the american revolution dar who asked if he might expand his ideas to encompass more of the american revolution this movie is the result by the time he had finished he had 14 reel history lesson and there wasn a trace of patrick henry anywhere br br we all know the story of the revolutionary war but griffith threw in love story with patriot farmer nathan neil hamilton falling in love with tory aristocrat nancy montague carol dempster leading lady for griffith for many years complicating matters is the fact that nancy father hates nathan well not just nathan he hates all rebels it does not help matters when during skirmish on the streets of lexington someone jostles nathan arm causing him to discharge his gun and accidentally wound nancy dad br br paralelling the love story is the mostly true but partially embellished story of capt walter butler lionel barrymore renegade british officer who feels he owes allegiance to no one with thousands of indians form the six nations on his side he hopes to crush the colonials and become monarch of his own empire br br comparisons with birth of nation 1915 are inevitable the montague family might just as well be the cameron from the earlier film while nathan could be part of the stoneman family the sequence of the battle of bunker hill is staged very similarly to scene in birth of nation with the attacking army in this case the redcoats storming trench packed with patriots the only thing missing is henry walthall charging across no man land to stuff flag into the muzzle of cannon amazingly enough the battle scenes in america seem to lack the energy of the battle scenes in birth and fail to draw the audience in something is clearly missing it isn scope w billy bitzer camera work is quite good maybe what is missing is dare say it sincerity br br the brutality of capt butler and his men is well underscored although much of it happens in long shot or offscreen don expect any heads to be lopped off in closeup like we saw in intolerance 1916 in one scene butler second in command capt hare louis wolhiem gouges out the eyes of captive colonist we see only the beginning of the deed for the remainder the camera focuses on hare face as he obviously has good time doing this lionel had been working with griffith on and off since 1912 story goes that he approached griffith for work and w knowing the reputation of his famous family said am not hiring stage actors to which lionel replied and am nothing of the kind sir he makes very good and quite believable villain louis wolhiem appeared with lionel older brother john three times in sherlock holmes and dr jekyll and mr hyde both 1920 and later in the tempest 1927 as capt hare his wild staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as villain but make you think he is quite mad also br br neil hamilton later remarked that america was his first time on horseback and was scared to death he hides his displeasure very well though and we can believe he was quite the equestrian by the time shooting was over mr griffith was very much in love with carol dempster and at one point asked her to marry him she refused and soon left his stock company after which her star status gradually waned br br speaking of horses one accidentally amusing moment which had to be unscripted came during the depiction of paul revere ride he rides his horse right up on the front porch of family to announce to arms the regulars are coming but as he tries to leave the horse cannot negotiate the steps backwards and stumbles spilling his rider on the ground am amazed griffith did not do another take br br so is america classic yes don wait for july 4th to see it it is enjoyable anytime &#39;,
 &#39; this is tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with voice over that pokes fun at everything french and then produces rather naif but very brave hero in fanfan la tulipe portrayed by the splendid gerard philippe the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous lollobrigida foretells notably that he will marry king louis xv daughter problem is la lollo soon find outs she too is in love with fanfan br br propelled by good sword fights cavalcades and other spirited action sequences the film moves at brisk pace and with many comic moments the direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un seriously that could not give those shortcomings second thought look out for noel roquevert traditional heavy in french films trying to steal la lollo making himself nuisance and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads la lollo hand and what gem marcel herrand is as the megalomanous and lust driven king louis xv that is not all so many beautiful women in one film makes me wish were in france and on the set back in 1952 the film may have come out that year but its verve cheek superb narration immaculate photography and the memorable gerard philippe ensure that it remains modern and pleasure to watch would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular do see it &#39;,

 &#39; is there anything that happens in this movie that is not predictable think not basically the movie is clichã after clichã and really nothing ever comes as surprise it makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension so for thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as drama it a failure this is because the movie its story is highly unlikely mean no way this could ever happen in real life as in the same way as the events occur in this movie so the movie has real suspense and credibility problem br br but it truly are the clichã that killed the movie it was cringing stuff at times everything is so formulaic in this movie the predator is portrayed as cool heartless almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as naive young woman who acts like she didn see any of this coming everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for reason such as the sequence in which the predator fixes the victims broken car that has got to be one of the oldest clichã out of the book knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them it was so incredibly obvious and cheap that almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point the movie is filled with moments like these br br the title might suggest that this is cheap porn movie but this in fact is sappy made for tv movie which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub plots to make the movie even more drama like br br ll admit that elizabeth berkley is pretty good acting in this movie she makes some of the clichã and events look even almost realistic at times her hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the paul verhoeven movie showgirls so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies and television series like this one it a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better all of the other characters are disappointment corey sevier plays the clichã pretty untouchable rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse he looks more like sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie he basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence he wakes up he wants sex before he goes to sleep he wants sex he gets home he wants sex it might be realistic thing but don know it just didn feel right for movie like this one and the story in general br br clichã filled movie and can think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie it predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility not an horrible movie and it certainly is watchable one at times but all the weak and clichã elements in the movie also make this far from recommendable one br br 4 10 &#39;,
 &#39; zoey 101 is basically about girl named zoey who transfers into an all boys boarding school during the first year that they integrate girls into it that raw plot line is ll admit pretty good idea although this show was meant for children five year old could probably point out its fatal flaws first zoey is clichã character her being super popular super attractive super smart and there nothing wrong with her no girl is like that it feels like the show was put the spotlight on jamie lynn spears and increase her fame dana who appeared at the beginning of the first season is just plain mean however in my opinion she was probably the most realistic character of them all which is sad seeing that dana is never nice nicole is too peppy and acts like complete airhead but mysteriously gets straight s lola seems to be able to fool anything with her emmy deserving acting skills quinn is supposed to be super smart and although she is able to create the most unrealistic things she is also made out to be weird and she never gets any guys although she is both beautiful and smart while zoey lola and nicole get guys and they re all beauty and no personality chase and michael are very similar and even sometimes get them confused logan is unrealistically rich and hands out millions like they re dollars nobody that rich ve also noticed that every character on the show is mean to that stacy girl who does nothing but act nice to them that not funny that mean and it just influences young girls to act mean to totally nice people finally the school itself adds the frosting to the unreal cake by providing the students with 5 star amenities such as scenic location sushi bar hot lounge equipped with free soda machines pool jacuzzi movie theater and the allowance for boys and girls to freely go into the other sex dorm rooms at most boarding schools if boy were to go into girl dorm or vice versa they would be expelled br br in conclusion zoey 101 was poorly written and should have spent few more years in the drafting process &#39;,
 &#39; 2005 was one of the best year for movies we had so many wonderful movies like batman begins sin city corpse bride history of violence coming up we also got brokeback mountain king kong but if this year the only great movie that came out was everything is illuminated then we wouldn miss all this year has brought the first movie as director of the talented liev schreiber is delightful heart warming touching drama that also brings one of elijah wood best roles he is perfect as jonathan curious man that heads for ukraine to find the woman who saved his grandfather in world war ii liev schreiber who also writes the movie conducts masterpiece with memorable scenes and lot of funny quotes this here is genuine mixture of comedy with drama bringing movie that will be commented years from now serious oscar contender everything is illuminated is powerful original and why not say illuminated movie but there one thing you should remember while entering the movie leave normal behind this is special 9 10 &#39;,
 &#39; according to john ford lyrically shot fictional biopic of abraham lincoln life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way ford camera has only praising views to reveal of mr lincoln early life but for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been series of gorgeous still frames ford has unique eye for telling story the film sings of the life of hopeful young man henry fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever lincoln to tee one of his best roles br br the film concerns two young men brothers on trial for murder that both claim to have committed in classic angry mob style the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them until honest abe steps into the fray he charms them with his humor telling them not to rob him of his first big case and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer what follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom murder dramas thereafter as abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links br br the film plays out like many john ford movies do tablespoon of americana dash of moderate predictability hint of sarcasm that you aren sure if you put in the recipe or if ford did it himself despite the overtly hollywood feel of the film and overly patriotic banter alluding to lincoln future presidency the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed if you can take your drama with grain of salt &#39;,
 &#39; oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isn clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that edison isn a real city takes away since live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didn they make it real city the only writing that was decent was tilman in which john heard did fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually shame to see john heard play such great bad guy with lot of screen time and the movie be washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the list &#39;,
 &#39; yes bad acting isn only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately br br nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn enough for me and for you too br br first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun smiling br br they find everything in the sea mean things like fishing net knife scuba dive things ropes bottles husband br br woodoo stuff are you kidding stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love peace love just stupid br br terrible skip this one please &#39;,
 &#39; don think that many films especially comedies have added memorable quotable dialog like moonstruck won illustrate it you can see remarkably long list of quotes on this thread but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me it is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory how about restaurant waiter who regrets planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client or nice elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon or perry john mahoney description of female student youthful promise as moonlight in martini my favorite line br br moonstruck is wonderful example of brilliant script first rate direction and good ensemble cast that fits perfectly there are other examples the drama the ox bow incident is another example but grimmer one cher olympia dukakis vincent gardenia nicholas cage john mahoney and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love and how to handle it is it good thing to be totally in love cher and cage at the end seem to think so but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy and cage gets glimmer of realization of this too when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la boheme is infidelity by men way of avoiding thoughts of death dukakis believes so and oddly enough although he is not totally convinced aiello chance reveals infidelity dukakis realizes early that gardenia odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness and cher literally stumbles onto gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera but gardenia also stumbles onto cher similar unfaithfulness to aiello but chance also causes misunderstandings fyodor chaliapin stumbles on dukakis walking with john mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair br br there are lovely little moments in the film too cher observation about flowers leading to receiving one her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it resolution but best is the sequence of louis guss and julie bovasso as cher uncle and aunt raymond and rita cappomaggi and rita charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him it is the sweetest moment of the entire film br br it is close to flawless film after seeing it over dozen times in as many years can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be when cher is at cage bakery his assistant chrissy nada despotovich mentions how she is secretly in love with cage but has been afraid to tell him earlier she was slightly snippy towards cher who put her in her place quickly yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry at the same time the fact that cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film but just as quickly dropped was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped besides one about cher and vincent gardenia working at homeless man shelter as penance it is small annoyance but think it is just based on desire to see more of this film because it is so very good &#39;,
 &#39; an awful movie at best with video quality similar to dead alive challenge anyone who is aliens james cameron 1986 movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped off from the first two alien movies to make this classic piece of garbage br br cast members such as lee ermey and ray wise were the only two actors with any talent and the lead jack scalia was really absolutely horrible think they cast him for his massive cleft chin was also annoyed with the stereotyping of the only black male on the set john toles bey who must look at this movie and just wonder look him up sometime as he has done lot of interesting movies br br but on this movie the script as said earlier was rip off of aliens tweaked and turned into submarine thriller it included such lines as got bad feeling about this and kill me as one crew member is infected by one of the mutants and his belly starts doing the alien hop just before it pops out of his stomach there is also rip off of the classic get some via bill paxton we also have bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls even the explosions of the mutated creatures is very similar to the popping of aliens as they charge marines in the movie aliens and the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid as opposed to having acid for blood there are many more major examples so if you want to see this script done well watch the first two classics alien and aliens with sigourney weaver you ll have more enjoyable time br br the plot could have been interesting and done better if not for confusing sequences in the start of the movie and generally poor editing camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn very hard to stop watching it and walk around the room to get snack or check email many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not the whole command structure between crew and capt was poorly done m not even sure if there are captains in the military that have full control over nuclear subs in general this just shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem at least little respectable and there are many other similar examples like dive depth etc br br if you like horrible movies or are big fan of alien and aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head at then this movie may be for you as for me this one is going back on the shelf permanently &#39;,
 &#39; now this is what d call good horror with occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget french movie caught my attention from the very first scene this proves you don need wild fx or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie br br the plot revolves around 4 cellmates in prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale most of the action we see through the eyes of carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates br br won say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen there few flaws though the fx are not that good but they re used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but malefique redeems itself by the time it over br br thought his was very good movie 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this is voice of person who just finished watching the second season of rome almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next this film conveniently takes off where rome ends if you find rome an abomination foul mouthed screw fest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy imperium augustus but if you feel rome is good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors br br there are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in rome especially disliked rome image of cleopatra as drug soaked sex addict there must have been great deal of strength and dignity in that woman and the actress in imperium suits the part much better toole and rampling are good and so are some others but then if you have come to know and love atia as the super cool bitch you ll find the depiction of her in imperium as tear jerking mother goose in an apron absolutely ridiculous there are supposed to be some bitchy characters in imperium but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more you ll find no interesting female characters in this epic there also the painfully comic maecenas whom we see as screeching drag queen even though there is little historical evidence that he was such he once referred to as being effeminate in his pleasures in the annals br br the interiors are rather meager and rely on clichã upon clichã cleopatra big hall looks like something out of computer game or children play room in an egyptian theme park there a looooooooot of really poor 3d graphics not up to 2003 standards br br the action is presented as series of flashbacks the aged augustus is reliving so we get quick look at some historical events some of which are presented well whereas some are not an disproportional amount of time is wasted to show livia as the eternal flame of augustus this affair doesn sizzle for even moment the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear inducing musical score whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing most of the actors are non english speakers br br everything is lukewarm in this epic true there are more historical accuracies than in rome but dramatically speaking it plain boring the characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness camera work is often reduced to static shots and lighting offers nothing to please your eye br br there really no one to love and no one to hate in imperium regardless of whether you liked or disliked rome there are much better films and miniseries around ancient rome the rise and fall of an empire would be one thing recommend &#39;,

 &#39; this film has some pretty gorey parts like boob getting bit off and other big bites castle freak himself is good monster would be scared to pieces if he was coming after me however the movie had some dumb parts about it br br husband goes drunk driving and kills his 3 year old son and blinds his teenage daughter suppose death is greater damage than blindness but you never know that the parents actually feel bad about their daughter being blind all they care about is that j dead while their teenage daughter walks around running into things and talking about how she ll never be able to drive car the parents are like honey stop walking around without guide you know better than that and then they cry and don ever stop being depressed because jj dead sounds like favortism to me br br the lines of dialogue are not very realistic or well done for example when giant crash is heard in the castle everybody runs down into the basement to see what it was it was huge mirror that crashed to the ground and shattered the husband runs to the broken mirror in horror and plainly says the mirror broke don know would say little more than that if giant mirror mysteriously crashed to the ground in my castle br br the husband and wife have some major relationship problems and it funny to watch how dumb they are with each other no one ever believes the blind girl advice if blind girl says she hears things believe her and don tell her to shut up think this is the moral of the story listen to people when they tell you things or else you might end up killing yourself to prove your point br br lastly thought the best character was the main police officer he was the best actor and character everyone else besides castle freak was pretty run of the mill 3 10 &#39;,
 &#39; from the first scene was really excited can tell this is going to be awesome thought the acting was so good felt as though was eaves dropping on these peoples lives the music too was exquisitely unsettling the plot started with sudden event and then drifted forward one could sense toward some irrevocable fate the build was slow but personally love that kind of thing as long as the quiet tension stays on track and doesn get derailed before it ready to pay off br br so everything going fine and then the fireworks begin and before you know it the credits are rolling what was all and my movie night companion could say if you understand the director intentions the blunt ending does make sense for those of you who have seen the movie already check out the very fascinating and hilarious interview with larry fessenden at filmcritic com but can help saying it was not pulled off quite right br br this probably could have been resolved with as little as ten more minutes of material before the climax in any case it too bad those ten minutes could have made all the difference in the world but for those of you who don write or make films you should know that crafting story arc with the proper timing is huge pain in the butt and am certainly not making this critique from any kind of pedestal br br wendigo feels to me like masterpiece that was given up on before it was finished but hay d take blunted masterpiece any day over an over produced piece of dog poo over compensated with too many digital effects like most horror movies these days br br one other comment some of the monster scenes left me confused as to whether should be scared or laughing don know how to explain it but there was distinctively monty python feel about this monster in his more blatent monster forms although this may sound like terrible criticism for horror movie don know it still worked for me in some crooked way will never look at deer antlers in the same way again &#39;,
 &#39; what if platoon of i from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate great pitch right the movie does exactly what it says on the tin br br thankfully the writers didn bother to explain the usually ridiculous in sci fi movies scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport no how or why they just did however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful if not bit dated not as silly as one would imagine br br the rest of the movie follows the premise to t but while it loses bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the i arrival to medieval japan it picks up with devastating battle sequence undoubtedly it the main order of the day the whole concept and by extension the movie itself was probably originated from this simple pitch what if i equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais and boy does it deliver br br the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70 action war movies not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length it also terrific mish mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like i samurai can deliver mean where else would you get the chance to feature tanks ninjas complete with shuriikens helicopter and samurais in the same shot the i platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras gunning them down with machine guns mortars grenades and tanks br br this mish mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai geki epic of kurosawa kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki samurai banners while the other is in western action and war movies there are stylistic touches like the wonderful slow motion shots and bloody violence that bring sam peckinpah or enzo castellari circa keoma to mind japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa and i samurai effortlessly turns this east meets west melting pot into an exciting film br br the film makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it not that tongue in cheek mentality is completely absent it just that it doesn try to pander to so bad it good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies the budget was probably hefty as it is evident in the hundreds of extras elaborate costumes very decent for production that is not traditional jidai geki and special effects the camera work and editing are all top notch almost better than movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves br br it not withouts its flaws either of course there are many song scenes where all sorts of 70 japanese rock disco and country songs play over montages there a bonding scene love interest scene war is hell scene etc the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing although it clocks at whooping 140 minutes it flies like bullet for the most part still some scenes flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for tighter effect br br the cast also deserves mention featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba isao natsuyagi goyokin samurai wolf tsunehiko watase the yakuza papers and hiroyuki sanada all of them hitting the right notes &#39;,
 &#39; the film had many fundamental values of family and love it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story the script was clear it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children and was enjoyable and humorous at times there were few charged symbols to look for the cinematography was acceptable there was no sense of experimentation that lot of cinematographers have been doing today which quiet frankly is getting little warn out it was plainly filmed but had nice soft quality to it although editing could have been done better thought it was nice movie for family to enjoy and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something didn like either but in all it was good movie &#39;,
 &#39; murder investigation goes on back stage while the vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film br br gertrude michael has the showy role of bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show stars kitty carlisle and carl brisson as well as starring in the infamous sweet marijuana number which was also on 70s bette midler album so while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective victor mclaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman br br we quickly learn that the maid dorothy stickney loves brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady jessie ralph is brisson mother and that the stage manager jack oakie butts into everything lots of plots twists among the musical numbers the show best known song is cocktails for two kitty carlisle also sings the haunting where do they come from and there a weird rhapsody that erupts into harlem specialty number featuring duke ellington quite the cast br br some terrific acting here especially gertrude michael and dorothy stickney kitty carlisle is quite good as well brisson is total zero though br br charles middleton plays homer toby wing plays nancy donald meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot ann sheridan and lucille ball among the show girls &#39;,
 &#39; daft potboilers don come much dafter than this but it a douglas sirk movie which makes everything alright except in this case it doesn based on sanctimonious novel by the sanctimonious lloyd douglas he wrote the robe and already filmed in 1935 with irene dunne and robert taylor it got more uplift than cantilever bra br br rock hudson is the arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for making jane wyman widow but later is directly responsible for the accident in which she loses her sight to make amends he takes up medicine becomes great eye surgeon and restores it no it sin quite that daft he had planned to become doctor before becoming an arrogant playboy in between times they fall in love br br try as might can quite find the redeeming social commentary and critique of american mores that are supposed to lie just below the surface of sirk films this one isn too deep on the plus side rock hudson isn half bad think am rediscovering him and of course it looks great in sirk films people live in rooms the size of cathedrals nothing in this film matches the best of his later work and even in soap opera terms this is definitely daytime tv &#39;,
 &#39; what is this its so bad the animation looks so terrible it looks like ps1 type game the actors are awful they just cannot act to save their lives sat through all of this film an then at the end was annoyed when realised had wasted 3 hours of my life ve not heard of this film did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd girl got shot what is up with that it was just stupid film they totally copied the day after tomorrow its got to be one of the worst films have ever seen would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this you could spend your time watching the day after tomorrow its lot better well thats what think of the film actually why have wasted my time writing about it ah dam its really annoying me its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now &#39;,
 &#39; for only doing few movies with his life the late great chris farley farley died at the end of 1997 and will be missed mostly by his co actor in tommy boy david spade from the lame police academy 4 spade really has done good with his career in films tommy boy is classic and we will always remember chris farley when we watch it from appearing on saturday night live to doing tommy boy black sheep beverley hills ninja almost heroes billy madison and dirty work think chris farley had short and successful career tommy boy was his best in my case and would watch over and over again and laugh at the same part each time thank you chris farley &#39;,
 &#39; tashan the title itself explains the nature of the movie br br this type of movies are actually made for flop what shame that yash raj films produces such movies those are worthless than grade movies or even some grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over confidently promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box office which it certainly deserved br br in my view this is the worst movie ever made from honourable yash raj films banner how come they handled such heavy project to new vijay krishna acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick he tried to imitate sanjay gadhvi ways of making like dhoom but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences br br the story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern tamil star rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions am not fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to saif hand instead of akshay just from the starting point expected of it but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become hit br br akshay has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but myself don think so instead she became slim yes slim it is good factor for female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that saif son ibrahim appears in the beginning last as young saif hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career br br those who like this tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to debutante director vijay krishna acharya who mishandled the project offered by yash raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions br br sorry don like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies &#39;,
 &#39; was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007 saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it release ever since so could send everyone know to see it it like taking trip to india colorful magical thought provoking aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic this is not bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy the characters are little broadly drawn but the acting was very good visually this movie is treat as you really do get sense of what driving through rajasthan is like dreamlike sometimes it hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real the movie has that same quality great soundtrack too &#39;,

 &#39; warning does contain spoilers br br open your eyes br br if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so just stop reading here and take my word for it you have to see this film have seen it four times so far and still haven made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film that is all am going to say because if you have not seen this film then stop reading right now br br if you are still reading then am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think br br remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well his name was mr krisak to me he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren all too keen on if we didn like shakespeare then he turned the story into modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it our class room was never room it was cottage and we were on the lake reading book at our own leisure time this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge like minds br br begin this review of vanilla sky with description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind like the phone number of long lost best friend and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix now if didn know better would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr krisak but giving them the benefit of the doubt we ll assume it wasn him but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable br br he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real show me how you can tell that you are real this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that m sure you can imagine everything from pain to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real after every scenario that we gave him he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless br br what if you are nothing but someone else dream br br what if you were someone else dream what messed up question that is this was question scenario posed to us about 15 years ago before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers how possible could it seem back then but if you look at today technology now ask yourself what it you were part of someone else dream br br another brilliant but surreal film this year david lynch mulholland drive explored similar areas but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to in short this is one film that will literally if you let it blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you br br open your eyes br br tom cruise plays david aames young hot shot righteous full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy his board of governers the seven dwarfs think he is rich dink born with silver spoon in his mouth they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them br br early in the film we meet one of david gorgeous toys named julie gianni played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz david and julie play good game both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in monogamous committed relationship this is the type of relationship commensurate with david other flings he had in the sexual prime of his life and although both talk good game we can tell that only one is really telling the truth br br next we meet brian shelby played with stroke of genius by kevin smith good buddy jason lee brian is writing book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense real caring for one another early on in the film brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again and that is the sweet ain so sweet without the bitter he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for night or two br br at david huge birthday bash so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him happy birthday brian enters with his date sofia sorrano played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress this is bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another and in typical david fashion despite his best friend being there he begins to flirt with sofia to complicate things julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david david then spends the night with sofia but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another there is no hanky panky the next day as david is leaving sofia apartment he is greeted by julie who offers him ride and from there well think we have all seen the commercials br br that is all will really say about the plot because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception we are introduced to character played by kurt russel and few other shady characters that all play part in this labyrinth like haze there is subtext of death and possible panacea like cure alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us but it doesn end there br br like many movies seem to thrive on today this film has secret sixth sense may have began this craze but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze regardless of how it originated vanilla sky has one of it own surreptitious gut busters and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through have seen this film four times and every time it has been because want to see if there is something more can pick up something more can understand to be able to work your mind in the theater to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in film all of the ersatz so called best pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular they lack substance beautiful mind was intriguing but flat the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven vanilla sky is rarity because it is film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it know this film has received mixed reviews but just think that those who don like it don quite understand it br br this is what film making is supposed to be like this is what film is supposed to do to you it is supposed to make you feel something most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces this one isn br br 10 out of 10 the best film of the year would love to see this get nominated for best picture and would love to see cruz up for best actress diaz for best supporting cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be shoe in for best supporting actor cameron crowe should there as well none of this may come to pass and that is shame this is one film that should not be missed br br and on final note am quite sure mr krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question can you prove you are real or are we just figment of someone imagination are we artificially transplanted for someone else bemusement this is film that spawns more questions than it does answers and m sure that is just fine with him br br open your eyes &#39;,
 &#39; would reccomend this film to everyone not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue but to all film buffs because it sincere moving funny and true because ligabue is born storyteller and film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care because his characters are loved and ask to be loved because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is real joy to watch and to listen at because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza who was like freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms because it a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls and because lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that thanks luciano &#39;,
 &#39; recognizing the picture of the diner on the cover of the dvd made me realize that this was local movie the word detroit in the title furthered my suspecions and did some looking up of things and yes local movie it was br br so picked it up someone knew actually knew some of the producers director dont remember which and said the producers directors got people to pay to be in this movie br br brilliant what great idea the movie makers get some capital to do the movie with thanks to their cast and crew then the investors cast crew others get some of the profits m imagining br br profits br br um anyways this film totally underwhelmed me the special effects were special as in special children who ride the small buses to school the acting was very amusing not intentionally however there a great line where guy says well this bone aint gonna smoke itself as pickup line unfortunately that is the only fun part of the whole film the story well sort of followed it about 3 5 of the way in then everything stopped making sense and as we were sitting there watching it it suddenly ended mean as in no resolution of anything like they ran out of time sorry folks out of time goodnight br br we sat there baffled and booing and threw in another film then about 20 minutes later neighbor of mine showed up with one of the guys from the movie we threw it back in and he the actor gave us running commentary which was awesome because he totally ripped on the movie br br what more could you ask for br br the most absurd scene for me was motorbike chase scene were it was so dark that it could have literally been guy running past with flashlight and not motorbike at all that and the jaw droppingly in your face sudden ending is enough to make you howl in pain the zombies looked less like zombies than my coworkers do and dont work at the morgue either br br so recommend seeing this if you can get someone from the movie to come over and give you running commentary as to all the things that went on behind the scenes and make sure this person hates the movie because that just adds to the fun br br otherwise give this one pass rent something like feeders if you want jaw droppingly bad in funny way movie &#39;,
 &#39; one hour eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and decided it was pretty lame that was right after hopalong chris lybbert drops on his horse from tree to rejoin the good guy posse was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy great bar 20 gimmick which didn translate into anything at all obviously the name coppola in the credits couldn do anything to guarantee success here even with more than one listed br br if you make it to the end of the film you ll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions did what exactly was the hook with the gloves what up with the rodeo scenario who was the stranger supposed to represent why did they make this film br br could probably go on but my energy been drained look there already western called the gunfighter from 1950 with guy named gregory peck as the title character watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad that one can recommend &#39;,
 &#39; revolt of the zombies has no redeeming features m tired of people arguing that it not that bad and that the effects must have packed more of punch in 1936 suspect this isn true it not like iq have risen sharply in the last 7 decades the average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today why just try watching the first scenes and count the pauses between things happening the awful choice of when to cut to close up the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue m going to make some tea go outside read my book now are you yes am that sort of exchange happens several times normally would love that being huge fan of bad movies but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away this sort of disinterested pot boiling time waster is far worse than energetic imaginative mind blowers like plan nine from outer space or santa claus conquers the martians those who claim that this is better than those more interesting movies have backwards idea of entertainment this movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment it bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom which is far worse &#39;,
 &#39; oh man if you want to give your internal crow robot real workout this is the movie to pop into the ol vcr the potential for cut up lines in this film is just endless br br minor spoilers ahead hey do you really care if film of this quality is spoiled traci is girl with problem psychology has developed names for it when child develops sexual crush on the opposite sex parent but this girl seems to have one for her same sex one and don think there a term for that it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette whose cute overbite neo flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters here dana is not only clueless to her daughter conduct she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition br br it possible that dana misses traci murderous streak because truth be told traci seems to have the criminal skills of hamster it only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of body count br br particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara carmen is so wise to traci scheming she might also wear sign saying hey m the next victim sure enough traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as bad joke rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as murder weapon as they are for changing tire br br in another sequence arquette wears flimsy dress to vineyard under cloudy skies talking to the owner cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies talking to the owner brother then cut to her wearing the first dress in the first location under cloudy skies but it supposed to be later you get the picture we re talking really bad directing br br as for skin don expect much although traci does own nice couple of bikinis br br for those looking for trash wallow 8 for anybody else 1 2 &#39;,
 &#39; this is an excellent suspenseful murder mystery movie not only was the plot full of suspense and intrigue but you get to see gorgeous ryan gosling for couple hours what not to love also sandra bullock is good in this movie ve always been fan of hers just wish she hadn decided to be in the lake house which was horrible but that another story altogether obviously since there are thousands of other murder horror movies out there there are bound to be similarities between them no need to bash this movie for having some similarities to at least few that have already been made anyway this is great movie for those of you that actually enjoy scary movies it a little dark and twisted but overall great movie &#39;,
 &#39; br br saw the glacier fox in the theatre when was nine years old bugged my parents to take me back three times began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering copy on an online auction site but would love to see it either picked up by new distributor and rereleased understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by the family channel disney etc and shown regularly it is fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of family of foxes in northern japan narrated by wise old tree the excellent soundtrack compliments the film well it would be good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to children movies today &#39;,
 &#39; would you be surprised if told you this movie deals with conspiracy no how about if told you the ringleader was shadow puppet what you don believe me ok yes made that up it too bad this movie could have used sense of humor understand charlie sheen doing this at the time another movie equaled more money as for donald sutherland and linda hamilton why don even get me started on stephen lang he was so much fun as the party crasher in the hard way and now this junk br br ah no matter everyone involved should feel ashamed if you aim to make bad movie and succeed it twisted but seriously doubt that was what they were aiming for here flat out the story stinks and we re actually supposed to take this yak seriously makes you wonder if this movie even had glimmer of hope seriously doubt it and in an industry so tight with the purse strings how this got green lit in the first place is beyond me maybe even more scary is how this dog pile made it way to theaters br br oh sam waterson how great you are in law order why are you here demoting yourself to the role of the president of the united states who might add gets to be shot at by remote control biplane controlled by the gonzo assassin then again this is masterpiece of work from george cosmatos who directing credits include rambo first blood part ii amongst other gems hmm case in point &#39;,
 &#39; this film was absolutely ugh can find the word oh wait crap mean when it started was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that caught late showing because it was utter filth ram gopal varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original sholay mean what was he thinking doing remake what was he trying to do be like sanjay leeli bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for black ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at what was amitabh doing he destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films first nishabd then cheeni kum then jhoom barabar jhoom and now this mean hes got to gather bit of his money and move as far away from bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and m telling you he already past half his way mean all this is really good for the other actors like shah rukh khan who getting really good name now because of the recent downfall of amitabh never really liked him because he thinks he god and just knew abhishek was going to be in that movie br br if you want to save your â 17 75 and spend it on something good go watch heyy babyy because that just the funniest movie ever and it number one in the charts &#39;,
 &#39; sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them this however wasn even guilty pleasure it was just crap some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was great idea to make movie he then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal couldn get through 20 minutes of it before turned it off it makes you got served look like citizen kane bat man wtf some guy that walks around with bat real original almost as good as calling him fat man and having fat guy walk around in superhero outfit &#39;,
 &#39; comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort the divorce of lady 1938 it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well suited to screwball comedy it all flows along nicely oberon is leslie young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan olivier hotel suite by way of nasty english fog preventing travel she does everything possible to irritate him but in the crazy way films go he falls for her and she falls for him but serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon lady that all she leaves oliver in note is thought by olivier to be married woman to make matters worse and more amusing lord mere ralph richardson goes to olivier wanting divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon there is some nice battle of the sexes dialogue and fun exploration of sexual politics you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy but in true olivier he a consummate professional and delivers and he handles the screwball twists and turns maybe not with ease but with gusto oberon was no great shakes as an actress but she was usually competent enough and despite their reputed off screen dislike of her worked well with olivier this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson but perhaps the print needs cleaning up &#39;,

 &#39; rajkumar santoshi without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinema br br this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make magnum opus br br in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh bachchan voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illness br br still the movie did nt had proper character development plus cinematography was nt good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with high budget the script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the movie br br the new comer shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography br br talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh br br but every director once in while in his career makes bad film br br so watch it only if you are fan of multi starrer flop movies &#39;,
 &#39; oh my oh this is really bad movie the acting is absolutely atrocious the script is god awful and the photography is simply dreadful br br what does make this movie stand out however is that you never once care about single soul good guy or bad guy living dying or dead in the entire 87 minutes oh he died huh figured they would was the best reaction could muster after each murder characters are so black or white that with the volume turned off you could still figure out who was who while the cast voices had an odd monotone quality throughout their faces give the impression that you re looking at an old silent movie with lot of eyebrow waggling exaggerated frowns and pensive looks each character is humorless passionless one dimensional one trick pony once they fulfill whatever their particular role in this fiasco demanded their creation they are summarily dismissed br br it vaguely made me think of what would happen if thomas borch nielsen director writer of skyggen american title webmaster decided to do low budget version of american psycho and got kind of distracted along the way br br this isn a particularly gruesome movie the cold passionless cast ensures that it isn an offensive movie the director plays it so safe that no one could possibly find it so it is simply and after all bad movie br br avoid it we were not so fortunate and actually paid to watch this bomb on pay per view as part of my penance m writing this review br br enough said &#39;,
 &#39; when braveheart first came out was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most rabid fans of the film when rob roy came out was intrigued and although enjoyed the film did not think it was great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has diminished braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the unflattering portrayal of robert the bruce who was without doubt scotland greatest king another is the historical inaccuracy of the film which tarnishes the film in proportion to the many historical distortions think am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the beginnings of mel gibson egomania can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing &#39;,
 &#39; gem of british caper comedy poor american schlub pinky green richard jordan playing another bad guy but this time an adorable one gets out of british jail and tries to go straight but his maintenance man job in bank is too attractive for his never reformed criminal friends headed up by really nasty ivan david niven in one of his last roles pinky resists but the lure of all that money is just too much for him things unravel and reravel and it all joyous to watch jordan must have played 20 bad guys in his career but he never played the same one twice this one is just too lovable to hate niven never played slicker bad guy oil all over two fine actors we ve lost that wish we had back &#39;,
 &#39; skullduggery is strange strange film based on the novel ye shall know them by vercors to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone skullduggery simply isn a very good film for me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can make its mind up how best to convey its message the first half of the movie is like watching standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook they stick out like sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching muddled disorganised movie br br an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple burt reynolds one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame susan clark after an arduous trek they stumble upon tribe of strange ape like creatures these primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man â the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans or perhaps race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual or even race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics the archaeologists call the tribe the tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery but things take devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen paul hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers he questions whether the tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued br br this was very early film in reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he in comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously not that reynolds can be blamed â he has an impossible role asked to play charming adventurer who really belongs in tarzan flick his character and the film are not relevant to each other clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox alexander knox and wilfrid hyde white major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comicalâ and that just not the right idea we re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that awfully hard when they look so unconvincing skullduggery is failed attempt to tell story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating the honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn do them justice worthy failure it might be but failure nonetheless &#39;,
 &#39; why is it that in the 50s and 60s italians made so of the best movies and then during the 70s and 80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies probably because art films didn make any money the cannibal movie unlike the zombie movie which was created by americans and exploited by italians is purely italian creation designed as mondo exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here eaten alive came during the cannibal movie heyday the director umberto lenzi hadn even hit his stride yet his genre classic cannibal ferox was still year away br br in plotting similar to read ripped off from ruggero deodato seminal cannibal classic cannibal holocaust woman janet agren receives word from the police that they ve received 8mm film from her sister she gone missing in africa and it suspected that the tribal ritual depicted on the film may have something to do with it mel ferrer as professor of somethingoranother tells her that man named jonas ivan rassimov has started jonestown like cult in new guinea and that where the sister is the woman hires guide robert kerman to take her through the jungle to find the cult and her sister and wouldn you know it the jungle is full of cannibals br br one sentence should sum it up if you ve seen on cannibal movie you ve seen them all mostly because these films steal shamelessly from each other lenzi copied cannibal holocaust to make this film and retooled this to make cannibal ferox deodato copied parts of this for hit and run and because they all share the same material they all feature the same traits awful photography boring scenery terrible dubbing overacting and exploitation exploitation exploitation genre fans will have ball since everyone in it is genre veteran rassimov and kerman have scenery eating contest agren exists solely to be naked raped or in peril plenty gore for all the sickos out there the cannibals who do actually appear to be native cannibals eat lunch met disguised as human flesh and in the grand tradition of cannibal movies any live animal shown onscreen is usually killed shortly thereafter overall really not good experience but m sure there are psychopaths out there who find this excrement entertaining know did &#39;,
 &#39; just caught wild rebels on one of the mystery science theatre 3000 archive compilations and this movie was so bad even the mst3k crew couldn make it entertaining there are some mst3k targets that were films whose concepts were so dippy they couldn possibly have been good movies like the green slime and others whose basic premises could have been made into genuinely entertaining films if their filmmakers hadn bobbled them in the execution wild rebels is film whose basic premise did make good movie three years earlier when don siegel directed his remake of the killers at universal both films are about failed racing driver who seduced by femme fatale into driving the getaway car in robbery masterminded by the woman boyfriend only in the killers the driver was john cassavetes the woman was angie dickinson and the criminal mastermind cast wildly but successfully against type in what turned out to be his final film was ronald reagan steve alaimo bobbie byers and willie pastrano are quite comedown but what really makes wild rebels an awful movie is the direction by william grefã note the accent over the final present in his on screen credit which has absolutely no sense of pace whatsoever and seems to let every shot run at least half again as long as it needs to to make its dramatic point it only pity that someone didn do mocking commentary on this movie now in 2009 the comparison between steve alaimo hairdo and rod blagojevich would have been irresistible &#39;,
 &#39; this is not great movie as tho the cast especially the kids admirably help to carry along this very sad yet contrived plot it is filled with clichã upon clichã poor family in 50 mid america dying mother alcoholic father 10 children 1 of whom has epilepsy and an awful decision to be made its very easy to watch and some of the kids performances are moving without being sickly or naff and little frank and warrnen steal the show for me with the last scene leaving me bawling no matter how many times see it great rainy afternoon movie recommend to all only those with the hardest of hearts could fail to be moved by it not on par to sophies choice but good tv movie equivalent &#39;,
 &#39; really hated this movie and it the first movie written by stephen king that didn finish was truly disappointed it was the worst crap ve ever seen what were you thinking making three hours out of it it may have quite good story but actors no suspense no romance no horror no it didn have anything br br it got this strange crazy science man with einstein hair the classic thing not real at all and man keep getting younger all the time it seems like they just used the name of stephen king to make crappy too long movie with nothing exciting at all br br give this movie 1 awful if they had like 5 would probably take that instead it was total waste of time &#39;,

 &#39; what we have here is downright brilliant piece of early 80 incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash cinema completely speechless wizards of the lost kingdom is very cheap and cheesy fantasy sword and sorcery adventure that doesn have an actual plot but does eagerly shamelessly borrows elements from other films writer ed naha and hector olivera who watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed handful of essential characters but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically in order to make fantasy adventure you need one super evil villain preferably with black cape one young hero in training one lone warrior one amiable type of furry pet one wise midget living in the woods optional and whole colorful collection of hideous demons enslaved dwarfs and winged gargoyles to serve as filler the story is phenomenal and so original with simon the young son of wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician shurka takes over the power and killed the king simon wants to go back and save the people but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape simon befriends lone warrior kor the usually cool dude bo svenson who clearly needed the pay check who assists simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals dangerous encounters and magical showdowns admittedly it doesn even sound too bad thus far but that merely just because excluded all the deliciously inept little details simon has best friend named gulfax for example gulfax is an albino version of chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle snout to yelp something incomprehensible the obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the plot and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of suspicious forest nymph kor settles an old score with the pig faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there the supposedly horrible suicide cave where you can only sing your way out of but the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence â not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema â involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors hoping they will assist them in their battle but the rotting corpses only take few steps complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves that it so much for the zombie sub plot best sequence ever could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs but you get the idea wizards of the lost kingdom is tremendously messed up so bad it good film word of advice do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone invite friends preferably the dope headed types with wicked sense of humor and watch it in group it will be night to rememberâ &#39;,
 &#39; first of all this is one of the worst soft core straight to cable erotic thriller ve ever seen in my life of course like all erotic thrillers are want to do it about brothel madam and is set in brothel this of course makes the softcore simulated sex that pops up every other 10 minutes seem in context whatever br br forget for one moment that this was never meant to win any awards the actors are terrible and their line reading made me cringe the woman who plays the female cop is so bad it beyond description she must be really really good friend of the guys who put up the movie for this terrible adventure if you know what mean br br the production values are only slightly higher than porn other than that suppose if you re really drunk and you need something to laugh at this would be perfect film and if that the case recommend fast forwarding to all the scenes with the female cop what that accent brooklyn hilarious &#39;,
 &#39; beforehand notification m sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here but when saw the preview for this movie was thinking finally have yet to see one movie about popular african influenced dance be it popular hip hop moves breaking or stepping where the main character was black woman ve seen an excessive amount of movies where non black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does mediocre job of it breakin breakin 2 save the last dance step up but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop african influenced dance and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn always men who performed it so felt this movie has been long time coming however the race does not make the film so also wanted it to carry believable plot the dancing be entertaining and interesting to watch br br pros really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture can recall ever seeing popular mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican had believable accents and weren stereotypical with the beanies the steppers family friends and even the thugs were all really intelligent realistic people who were trying to love live and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive even when the audience was made aware that the main character sister chose an alternate lifestyle it still didn make the plot stereotypical was satisfied with the way it was portrayed loved the stepping the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers the trials that the main character parents were going through and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in barrel respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world they were all just as excellent as the fellas don see that in too many movies nowadays at least not those that would be considered black films br br cons m not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this but question whether they ve been to real step shows whenever the steppers got ready to perform some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers hand feet beats at real step show there is zero need for music other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups and then when hip hop songs were played sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers hands and feet it was awkward was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus stomp the yard another great stepping movie because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys in stomp the yard meagan good got all of few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the deltas let out chant and few steps and were cut immediately even when there were very small scenes the ladies tore it up especially in the auto shop and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music know soundtracks have to be sold but the movie folks could ve played the music in other parts of the film br br m not keyshia cole fan so every time saw her all kept thinking was is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks she looked uncomfortable on screen to me thought they should ve used host like free or rocsi instead deray davis was funny as usual though also groaned when found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto like stepping couldn possibly happen anywhere else hollywood as usual however only couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers which mainstream movies tend to do br br would ve given this movie five stars but the music playing killed it for me definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs &#39;,
 &#39; contains major spoilers on the off chance you would actually care about the story line br br ok we have storms that destroy city and computer hacker who clobbers the power grid br br predictable schlock from the start and if that weren enough the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been for example will they make it to the airport in time things look dim as we go to commercialâ and the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane well guess they re gonna make it after allâ but then again they had to because they re good guys br br the acting wasn any too impressive exception and welcome relief randy quaid as tornado tommy the effects were kinda lame the bad guys got it and the good guys came through the real disaster of this movie was the script especially the ending not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as soap opera given 24 hours notice of cancellation but they glorified the hacker as well intentioned so he caused bazillion deathsâ he meant well and of course an uplifting final tv report about people coming together barf it was everything expected from the commercials and m glad wasted my time watching it it will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow br br is cbs insulting us by making this sureâ but we watched it didn we did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig br br here hoping for the next plan 9 from outer space which gets better with each viewing this isn it br br 1 star &#39;,
 &#39; the movie follows the events of the novel cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni could be translated as the most beloved among humans written by marin preda very controversial book and movie novel which became something like the bible or the story of hamlet very popular and hard to get due to its satiric contents over the communist regime it represents the drama of the intellectual man the humanist in red world movie filled with passion fear sexuality all the great ingredients for great movie recipe one of the greatest romanian movies despite its psychological charge after all it is an european movie &#39;,

 &#39; 1904 the north african nation of morocco is hanging onto tenuous independence as the various european powers france germany britain russia spain and now the united states are vying for influence in the region the sultan marc zuber is weak puppet his uncle the bashaw vladek sheybal who is being manipulated by the french and germans is the real power behind the throne enter berber chieftan raisuli sean connery the leader of the rif tribe and the last of the barbary pirates who kidnaps an american missionary eden pedecaris candice bergen and her two children and takes them hostage back in the us president theodore roosevelt brian keith threatens to go to war over the issue pedecaris alive or raisuli dead seeing the issue as the perfect way to exercise his big stick diplomacy though secretary of state john hay john huston is not so confident however the raisuli has less sinister plans for the pedecarises who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event br br john milius great historical film based very loosely off of true story e pedecaris was middle aged man is wonderful bit of escapism it has some amazing action scenes witty well written script fine cast enjoying themselves with the material and does not overstay its welcome like say pirates of the caribbean or the lord of the rings movies it not really an epic film in the strictest sense but it one of the best pure action movies ever made br br while the historical context is shaky the storyline is interesting and as some reviewers point out it is even more pertinent today than it was when made as president roosevelt says america is like grizzly bear fierce strong but little blind and reckless at times at the time of the film setting america has just been propelled onto the world stage as superpower following their resounding victory in the spanish american war and roosevelt seizes this incident as way to prove america worth in real life it didn quite work out that way but allegorically it works well while written from right wing perspective milius screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing america and its place in the world he admires roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy and correctly recognizes in the words of roosevelt that while america may be feared and respected they ll never be truly loved by the world no matter what they do and there are some scenes like roosevelt target shooting of european leaders and the almost comic surprise attack by marines on the bashaw palace which show america reckless and violent side while others the climactic showdown with the germans show their heroism br br the historical political context of the film is of course merely meat on the bones of what is essentially rousing action adventure film there are some brilliantly done action scenes such as raisuli rescue of the pedecaris from double crossing tribesmen which features some of the best swordplay in any film the opening entrance of the raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the us marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces and the final battle which combines elements of lawrence of arabia and the wild bunch while major historical fantasy three way battle between germans americans and the rifs is superbly staged adrenaline pumping sequence br br the excellent cast gives some wonderful performances everyone seems to be having fun time with the film and it shows sean connery is surprisingly convincing as berber with scottish accent but manages to pull off his interesting well drawn and chivalrous character who comes to respect his hostage and abhors modern uncivil warfare candice bergen an actress whom ve never been fond of gives fine performance as the feisty eden pedecaris who is every bit as tough as her captor brian keith is an amazingly convincing tr you really feel he must have been like this an athletic blustering yet practical and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self the scenes of roosevelt boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are some of the greatest bad ass moments in movie history and who can forget lines like why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality john huston provides solid support as the weary cautious hay acting as perfect foil to the much more impetuous roosevelt br br among the fine supporting cast the best are geoffrey lewis as samuel gummere the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of the political intrigue and steve kanaly as the gung ho marine captain who cheerfully advocates and carries out military intervention as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation other familiar faces such as vladek sheybal nadim sawalha roy jenson larry cross marc zuber and darrell fetty also do fine work no matter how small their role spaghetti western fans will recognize antoine saint john fistful of dynamite as the german general and aldo sambrell as one of raisuli tribesmen br br the wind and the lion is all around wonderfully done adventure film it has something for everyone wonderful gun and swordplay lot of humor tough feisty heroine and her two cute children nice if unconsummated romance and an interesting if fanciful political historical context it not masterpiece but hey it wasn trying to be give the wind and the lion stirring nine stars and my highest recommendation &#39;,
 &#39; nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible br br in the end that is what kills it the blandness is just not good can say expected better from will smith but definitely did from kevin james of the king of queens but hey m getting used to saying that lot lately this film attempts to make its mark as witty romantic comedy but it never hits the bull eye in fact it never hits anywhere within the target the allergy scene is disturbing the fact that kevin james can dance is something that wouldn exactly catch anybody off guard and is therefore in movie like this not funny this movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong ploy at the wrong time some parts are okay but m searching my brain for examples but really think this movie should be avoided &#39;,
 &#39; can say enjoyed this as much as the big lebowski or raising arizona and felt little slighted but brother is an enjoyable film worthy of some good laughs and taste of the coens brisk twisted sense of creativity the dvd edition contains the featurette and was interested to find out that the coens are pretty simple in their directorial techniques that surprised me of course this movie is not the best example and m only saying this in comparison and it wasn worthy of any oscars many feel it was robbed but maybe it depends on the appeal br br though enjoyed the coens previous work ve never been fan of old westerns or the dukes of hazzard or any of that stuff they show daily on tnn guess that why didn feel as enthusiastic about checking out this movie seeing that it revolves around southern folk for all those from the south who are reading this don mean to offend any of your people m sure you guys feel the same way when you watch movies about urban areas like bronx tale when you live in the city all your life it hard to get accustomed to films of this nature but all apologies aside found the characters fun and quirky think john turturro nailed the accent perfectly and seeing the way he talks in real life find that amazing tim blake nelson was also good of course george clooney who assume is not the best at feigning accents judging by his decision to chuck the idea of working with dialogue coach and developing new england accent for the perfect storm naturally seems little miscast and continually struggles with the accent his performance was good though you can also spot coen regulars like holly hunter in short but sweet role and john goodman also on screen for short time but steals every minute of it br br though don normally dig country music liked the title song man of constant sorrow the dvd also contains the music video for that song br br overall found the film entertaining and original but it doesn have that in your face quality that the coens have shown to us in the past it a slighter effort but good one still suggest you check it out br br my score 7 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; first let get it out of the way yeah this film steals lot from darkness falls 2003 the plot for darkness falls goes something like this the tooth fairy murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge in the tooth fairy 2006 the disfigured tooth fairy who yeah hides her face unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone little too similar to be coincidence br br but what must be asked is this if you re going to directly steal the exact plot from movie why choose something as mediocre as darkness falls sure it made few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered low budget straight to video movie will not have that same effect and it didn br br as watched the opening 15 20 minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didn seem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an ex doctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like busey and some hot veterinary student jenifer from argento masters of horror jenifer after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clichã including but not limited to some crazy old person with an unheeded warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold br br one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with target audience it kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had more mature feel when star the stripper and whatshisface the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to more stupid err immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of are you afraid of the dark only less scary br br technically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is subpar as is the acting for the most part on the plus side there some excessive gore at parts including fairly cool yet painfully predictable woodchipper scene and pretty vicious nailgun scene also if you re looking for bit of the sexy stuff there a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that there not much to bother with when it comes to this film br br if you re huge fan of darkness falls do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in different way but that about the only reason can find to see this one br br final verdict 3 10 ap3 &#39;,
 &#39; d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england but was in many ways very pleased when finally saw it there are lot of great things to the film for start the acting its not something have all that much need for in horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script with nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it give the film real solid backbone add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films winner it has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery also the characters of marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only gripe was that wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole d really recommend this to serious horror buffs &#39;,
 &#39; this movie has one or two slightly interesting gags but they are not worth the wait after an unexplained argument between two guys picking up litter in drive in movie theatre we cut to family leaving hollywood and driving driving driving driving their camper van across the screen again and again as inane dialogue is voiced over at least think it inane the terrible song that accompanies this montage is mixed so loud it renders the dialogue at times almost inaudible br br finally the camper van arrives at night at gas station where the family get out have another inane conversation before driving off the camera then pans across to reveal the actor we have just seen drive away he talks straight to camera and we realise he is the director of the movie we are watching which is about him and how he came to make the movie br br nice idea which almost but not quite makes the previous sequences worth the pain br br as the movie unfolds he encounters the two characters we met picking litter at the start of the movie and they all form motion picture company br br all sorts of not very funny and clumsy comedy ensues as they put together crew and attempt to raise the cash needed to start filming br br this movie was obviously put together on shoe string and promise and there is nice little idea in here struggling to get out but the execution is so inept that the idea gets lost comedy is more than things just falling over and everyone talking or shouting at once so much of the dialogue here is shouted by several actors simultaneously robert altman can do this sort of thing well because he has script rehearsals decent sound techies and editing facilities everyone shouting at the one mike which by the sound of it was hidden in dustbin in the next room does not make for clarity &#39;,
 &#39; well here comes another well romantic comedy but unlike all others movies of this genre this is by far the best have seen in long while br br ll admit at first wanted to watch this movie because of megan fox and little because of simon pegg br br first of all if you have watched decent amount of movies you will know that sidney and alison would be together at the and of the movie one way or another but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won know how br br okay now this movie is just made for simon pegg can see any other actor in the role of sidney and m sure this would be very weaker movie if not for pegg great performance br br there is number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard courtesy of simon pegg character sidney but think everyone in this movie is good for example kirsten dunst is really solid in this movie usually don think of her as any more than an average actress but she was really good in this one then there jeff bridges there gillian anderson and of course megan fox who plays spoiled bitchy star sophie maes great role for her br br all in all while usually don agree with ratings her on imdb this time would completely agree with them br br go and see this movie it is really light hearted and positive and recommend it deeply my rating 7 out of 10 well 7 5 actually &#39;,
 &#39; warning contains spoilers br br written by husband and wife wally wolodarsky who also directed and maya forbes this indie film is one of the better romantic comedies in recent memory br br jay mohr takes break from playing smarmy weasels to be the nice guy faced with the fact his fiancã wants to bed other people and he allowed to do so too julianne nicholson who was so good in tully plays spunky and vulnerable with great gusto too bad she doesn get the recognition she deserves br br good supporting performances help immensely too lauren graham who made last year bad santa memorable plays the jaded cynical sister to perfection bryan cranston the dad on tv malcolm in the middle gets few funny raunchy moments and andy richter plays genial guy who falls for single mother helen slater in credible albeit familiar role as mousy woman br br what surprised me most about seeing other people was how funny it is there are some genuine laughs here ed first attempt at meaningless sex gets some great lines and there a mã nage trois that elicits one of the most truthful reactions from man as the male fantasy gets tweaked br br the film premise isn unusual but liked that it was alice nicholson who thought of it much to the chagrin of ed mohr given the genre you know that no matter how good her intentions are alice plan is doomed we see how the couple works through this strange situation initially alice and ed are turned on by the idea but then the human element sets it br br appreciated forbes and wolodarsky not turning this into cheap sex romp yes there sex and nudity but there also are real emotions at work here the other people alice and ed befriend don want to be the objects of casual sex they have feelings too in one case too many feelings br br granted some scenes run one joke too many the richter slater subplot isn necessary and alice does something truly uncharacteristic but that forgivable because mohr and nicholson generate such tremendous intimacy and honesty check out the scenes where ed rummages through alice underwear drawer or his reaction to her announcement about ending the experiment that no matter how much we might enjoy their little game we root for this couple to succeed br br unfortunately this film got little if any publicity and limited release hollywood studios whose romantic comedies often veer on the unfunny turgid and unsurprising would do well to learn from this intelligent and funny film &#39;,
 &#39; what terrible movie it represents perfectly the state of degenerateness of french society where the most elementary respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared the plot is nonsensical the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting to say the least the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired catherine deneuve is as bad an actress as she always was even when she was directed by bunuel in belle de jour the rest of the usually good cast vincent lindon line renaud jean yanne seem completely lost in an ocean of vulgarity platitudes and restlessness cannot help to draw parallel with the wonderful james ivory le divorce with its thoughtful depiction of french and american mores its superlative cinematography and stellar cast put to good use having watched le divorce you can feel kind of empathy with the french regardless of their foibles belle maman leaves you with only nauseated contempt for its morally bankrupt and clueless protagonists &#39;,
 &#39; this film kind of like conan the barabarian but with more sex rape and murder there is plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don do good job showing it which is shame because it could be decent story richard hill gives solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren too bad either love the way deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims and there plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br all in all not good but not necessarily that bad either &#39;,
 &#39; even mst3k couldn make this painful long and ultimately mind bending drek funny or entertaining while most bad movies in and of themselves are hilariously bad this one is one of those few videos that uses the word bad in its literal sense br br the element that makes this so painful to watch is not the lack of story but the fact that soooo much background is crammed into the first half hour that it is utterly ridiculous and harder to follow than highway while driving with no headlights br br the hero of the film ator is no more than eye candy for this literal energy sucker of film dressed in loin cloth and sporting pecs like melons as joel put it he belongs more in fitness magazine than here br br would recommend this only to die hard and mean die hard followers of cheese if you have an enemy recommend them this film if you make it through this commend you you should be able to make it through anything &#39;,
 &#39; very great movie br br big love story lots of sword fighting huge battle scenes heros and villains real history br br few in the west know much chinese history chin zchaundi founded china the country is in fact named after him some are familiar with the terra cotta army recently unearthed this is historical epic of how he ended the period of contending states and unified china he founded dynasty that only last 14 years but it was immediately replaced by the han dynasty that permanently defined chinese civilization ever since br br chin or the king of zheng as he was known before he founded the empire was roughly contemporaneous with scipio hannibal and fabius in the west the parallel roman world dominance west and east worlds was achieved without single towering personality like chin it would not be for another century before the west produced caesar the nearest comparable western figure br br chin is shown very sympathetically here in the beginning but he develops over the course of the film into ruthless despot history only records the ruthless despot part but the sympathetic beginning leaves room for real character development over the course of this long film the famous story about the meeting with the assassin is as true as any two thousand year old anecdote can be gong li is lovely she is the emotional core of the story it all makes for great movie making &#39;,
 &#39; saw this movie partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at netflix and from it leaned valuable lesson not lesson about ethnic diversity however the lesson learned is don trust reviews br br yes racism sucks and people are complicated but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they do see it the only reason that can think of for the number of good reviews is that it being reviewed by people who aren used to thinking or who ve seen their first thought provoking movie and somehow think that haggis invented the concept in fact he basically made this film which should be called racism for dummies as emotionally wrenching as possible seemingly to give people who don spend lot of time thinking the impression that they ve discovered some fundamental truth that never been covered in film before zen and the art of motorcycle maintanence it not an after school special for the unthinking masses cut into bite sized overwrought ham fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection br br it as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme simply to make us happy that we re such good people because we don identify with the characters let face it people nobody identifies with these characters because they re all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse stereotypes it well acted even if the dialog is atrocious and cleverly executed so much that you don think to ask where the beef until you can tell the film is winding down the flaming car scene was well executed like much of the movie but went nowhere in the end br br the messages are very heavy handed and from the behind the scenes blurb the producers were clearly watching different movie because there is very little to laugh about in this movie even during the intended funny parts have to stress that this is not entertainment more like high school diversity lesson call it the blood on the highway of racism they could even show this in high schools if it weren for the side nude shot of jennifer esposito br br in this film everyone a jerk and everyone learns lesson except for michael pena who gets the best role but the most predictable storyline br br this is bad film with bad writing and good actors an ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who can handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling picture painted with crayons br br crash is depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things &#39;,
 &#39; this is an interesting movie think it very humorous although the humor is very black fulci is good and funny acting himself it a really funny and truly crazy self portrait of an artist make horror films if would make love films no one would buy tickets and it really sexy movie also almost all the time there is some action or tension going on and many sexy girls women maybe it goes to the core of why anyone starts to do movies art in the first place it a real psychedelic trip maybe best seen little drunk or some similar state of mind there is some really nasty gore scenes also of course because it lucio fulci as matter of fact some of those scenes are quite disgusting anyway it one of the three best and most complete fulci films ve seen the others are house by the cemetery zombi haven seen the beyond actually the script is overally to my opinion quite ingenious you could see this movie as portrait of an extreme neurotic or person who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder fashionable words the character has compulsive need to confess crimes or bad thoughts especially crimes he hasn even done and he questions himself all the time what if have done it what if want to do it have done it do want to do it he overreacts and exaggerates his thoughts m sure fulci has been interested of psychology and maybe even read something of the area in his house by the cemetery movie for example there is character named freudstein this is maybe the most concentrated and straightly personal movie fulci did also like the simplicity of the photography pictures in this film only thing that disturbs me little bit is the sadism especially towards women don quite understand why is it entertainment is it art is it horror anyways and overall this is really interesting and well made movie definitely recommended classic film at least for fans or anyone interested of this genre for the others it may be too much &#39;,
 &#39; okay had watched this movie when was very little and the day that we were cleaning out the closet see this thought have no idea of what this movie was like so went ahead and put it in oh my god this film is so darn bad never thought that this film could ever get as close to my least favorite film as it did but did laugh because all the jokes were so corny and ridiculous not funny so much stuff in this movie was funny because it was so stupid this film is not anywhere near good would have to say if you want to watch this movie you definitely better not expect anything big and if you ve already seen it trust me feel your pain as well &#39;,
 &#39; yeah that about sums it up this movie was horrifying two minutes in wanted to gouge my eyes out this has been praised as an innovative lds comedy but it not even good for members of that church don think any human being should be so victimized as to watch movie of this low quality br br first of all you can tell that absolutely no effort whatsoever went into this movie it seems as if the horribly drab glib trite plot was thrown together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift for coherent at least semi coherent thought then there the acting which is dismal from everybody involved even the cameos fail to liven anything up br br and let not forget the fact that our protagonist is shallow jerk who we would like to believe can change but that road is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue appallingly hideous gags and lot of mormon in jokes that anyone in their right mind lds or not should consider purely stupid this has to be one of the worst films ve ever seen &#39;,
 &#39; there are not many films which would describe as perfect but rififi definitely fits the bill no other heist film has come close to it before or after the plot is simple but engrosses you it never ceases to amaze me how absolutely gripping the film is every time you view it you care for all the characters even though they are bank robbers because they are presented as human beings with all their problems and flaws it hard to imagine any other actor besides jean servais in the role of tony le stã phanois when the members of the crew are each talking about what they are going to do with their money and finally get to tony his answer and the expression on his face says it all while the 30 minute heist sequence is the most famous part of the movie and rightfully so the film actually gets better afterward the director jules dassin knew what he was doing when he decided to not have any music during the heist scene or the final shootout but instead inserted great climactic score during tony final ride towards his destiny to think that if dassin an american director had not been blacklisted in hollywood and forced to work in france this masterpiece of cinema would never have been made the way it was it certainly wouldn have been as good if it was made as an american film during that time it was absolutely horrible what dassin had to go through but he did achieve his greatest work because of it to the benefit of all of us m just cringing at the thought of the upcoming al pacino remake most heist films since rififi have already borrowed from it in some way or another there no reason to remake this masterpiece other than money leave the classics alone &#39;,
 &#39; the original animated dark knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals mask of phantasm in its coolness there a lot of style and intelligence in mystery of the batwoman so much more than batman forever or batman and robin br br there a new crime fighter on the streets of gotham she dresses like bat but she not grown up batgirl and batman is denying any affiliation with her meanwhile bruce wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work but the penguin bain and the local mob makes things little more complicated br br didn have high hopes for this un since being strongly let down but the weak batman sub zero robin isn featured so much here but was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces the clever plot and cheeky sense of humor this is definitely movie no fan of batman should be without keep your ears open for really catchy song called betcha neva which is featured prominently through out br br it a shame the dvd isn so great don get me wrong there are some great features the short chase me is awesome and very cool dolby 5 1 soundtrack but the movie is presented in pan and scan batman mystery of the batwoman was drawn and shot in 1 85 1 but this dvd is presented in 1 33 1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there is picture cut off on both sides find this extremely annoying considering mask of phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen warner have had to re release literally dozens of movies on dvd because people have complained about the lack of original aspect ratio available on some titles why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me br br would give this dvd 5 5 but the lack of oar brings the overall score down to 4 5 it a shame because widescreen would have completed great dvd package &#39;,
 &#39; if you asked me to pick the best acted movies ever made this movie would be on short list along with 1951 streetcar named desire imagine ll discover some others that qualify but kramer vs kramer is an outstanding exercise in naturalism so its very satisfying experience on that level just watching the marvelous probing performances of dustin hoffman meryl streep and the child justin henry in particular one of the best child performances ever br br but also find it very satisfying to watch because its such thoroughly involving story it always makes me forget my own problems it has such excellent narrative drive once you stick kramer vs kramer on and alice kramer leaves ted to juggle work and their young son telling him nothing more than she has to discover herself you keep watching to know that everything turns out okay for them and even once you know how things do turn out each moment of the ride just rings so brilliantly true that its joy to watch it happen again and again br br make no mistake kramer vs kramer is not light entertainment its very realistic portrayal of the effects of divorce on everyone involved br br 10 10 br br for one of the best scripts born out of conversations between benton and hoffman who was going through divorce at the time ever written executed and performed beautifully and faultlessly not to mention what great involving story it is put simply perfect film &#39;,

 &#39; give director stanley tong of jackie chan super cop and rumble in the bronx and what do you get you receive series of kung fu fights and lack of magoo like madness br br the limited plot has magoo leslie nielsen put into an international plot where he steals world renowned gem of course he has no idea what he is doing in fact he has no idea that he had the gem br br within thirty minutes you could get very bored watching this there are some very funny moments though like when he is cooking the chicken you will wish that you were as nearsighted as magoo its fun movie to watch but its quite disaster you have to love leslie nielson because he was made some very funny movies this isn his best but he does good job playing magoo thought it was funny film and it should be recommended to young children because they will probably think that its very funny &#39;,

 &#39; bought this film on dvd despite the stale review and that was idiotic that review was completely accurate and have never seen any worse erotic film in my long life even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings plus nice cover but my own extreme erotica films are over 100 times more erotic just in the soft delicious aspect with probably less than 100 times of this films budget the story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book or any new exciting element of slave training except some very strange and sad developments then did the main male character klaus kinski not look bit like the second master of he try to play and not even lovely arielle dombasle did look delicious in any scene &#39;,
 &#39; yes said title line does actually appear in this movie why m not sure when the line was actually being said didn somebody in the crew filming at some point laugh would have liked to see the outtakes from this movie mostly because think they would be more entertaining than the movie itself br br helmed by director jim gillespie know what you did last summer comes teen slasher movie that seems to assume we haven ever seen teen slasher movie before of course he not to be given all the blame there are also three writers responsible and this is somehow based on video game that still in production the title of said game is backwater but upon looking for information on it came up with absolutely nothing br br and so we begin the movie would like to say before continue that wasn expecting this to win an oscar when am in the right mindset enjoy fun horror movie to pass the time think there exists an opportunity for an effective original and smart slasher movie venom is not this movie br br there is almost no character development at all that fine you don expect whole lot however instead of well knit cast of few this movie decides to introduce us to the following many horror movie clichã characters br br 1 the final girl she has just broken up for her boyfriend this means that at some point in the movie when they are in peril they will decide to get back together again which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last remaining survivor of the movie eden is played by agnes bruckner without much enthusiasm might add br br 2 the boyfriend he just around to co exist with the final girl until his demise sure he can save her but he doomed and we know it eric is played by jonathan jackson br br 3 the bimbos usually horror movies only feel the need for one of these but here we have two they shoplift they steal they might show their breasts not in this case or they might possibly be alcoholics staple of the genre they also wander around in dimly lit areas all on their lonesome usually saying things like hello is there anybody there tammy and patty suitably named are played by bijou phillips and davetta sherwood br br 4 the jackass sure he looks pretty but he the idiot in the movie that inserted purely to be an idiot he says stupid things does stupid things has obviously never seen horror movie and is one of enjoyable kills you watch this kind of thing for sean is played by j cotrona br br 5 the girlfriend she loves the jackass even though pretty much nobody else does and she usually the one left alive for while so she can scream and cry until she starts tripping and gets left behind rachel is played by laura ramsey br br 6 the creepy janitor in this case the creepy gas station attendant enough said ray is played by rick cramer br br could continue but think you get the picture the remaining characters aren so much common as they are equally killable there the gay guy pawel szajda as ricky who definitely got robbed as far as screen time is concerned and the one who knows what going on of course none of that matters because at first everyone always thinks that one crazy cece is played by meagan good br br there are couple other characters namely deputy played by method man but he and others are killed off pretty quickly and get even less character development than the following clichã br br so you re probably thinking why does this movie require such deep analysis it just summer horror flick for cryin out loud based on that question does it deliver the goods yes and no the acting isn particularly convincing even given the amount of talent involved bijou phillips was hailed for her performance in larry clark bully and agnes bruckner has been an up and coming talent for while now br br so what about the gore there some that really about it lot of the juiciest bits are cut aways namely scene involving somebody face and sandblaster used to remove paint from cars br br to the filmmaker credit there are couple interesting scenes liked the bit where part of house was literally ripped off so that the unstoppable villain could get to the characters br br if this had all been centered around smarter screenplay in which the characters didn make the same dumb mistakes literally hundreds of horror movie characters had made before them it might have made for more enjoyable experience all of the most interesting characters are immediately killed off in the first third of the movie and then it just becomes not particularly interesting countdown until we know it just the creepy janitor and the final girl br br suppose must be little jaded but as horror film fan m left wondering why should have bothered when could easily have written better screenplay myself won even mention the numerous instances of terrible cgi &#39;,
 &#39; the script was very weak o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them the script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced the story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue on technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times then again this could be called blessing overall this same story could have better been told in short film a running time under 30 minutes the obvious in your face homages to sam raimi and evil dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like bald faced rip off mon this kind of 35mm budget and this is the best that could be done still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed &#39;,
 &#39; saw the move while in paris in may 2006 was debating between that and mission impossible am very glad choose oss 117 not only because it was funny but might as well watch french movie while in france had great time would recommend it it is important to have some understanding the french society of today to really enjoy the humor of this movie cannot wait for the dvd to come out don know how some of the jeu de mots puns would be translated in english ll certainly buy it when it is out s saw on brice de nice which is movie starring dujardin that all kids were talking about in france this movie is comedy but sillier than one can imagine in comparing both movies have to say that dujardin did good job in oss 117 &#39;,
 &#39; what an awful adaptation the worst part was the music saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in story set in the early 1800 the only character that didn bore me to sleep was robert hardy had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one and love jane austen movies usually didn even rent it borrowed it from the library they should have paid me to take it don quite understand how catherine and henry managed passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another isabella and her brother were way overdone it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of jane austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good isn this is probably on my list of the ten worst movies ve seen &#39;,
 &#39; the movie with its single set minimal cast and straightforward photography except for couple of brief special effects reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv early years nonetheless the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood swings kills her and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan he wasn very versatile watching him essay comedy is almost painful but no one was better at wounded idealism on dangerous ground or the psychic pain of this movie few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure br br lupino problem is that she locked up in her house with man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape it a nail biter all the way this is not one of lupino many fine soulful parts that she was so good at instead it a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting ryan already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive looking ryan scrubbing the floor she starts getting coy flirting with her budding sexuality sensing trouble ryan abruptly fends her off finesse is not his strong suit insulted whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work women work that does it up to that point he been courteous and professional with lupino trying to set himself on normal path but whiting has hit his raw nerve now there heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door leaving lupino to pay the price it a riveting scene expertly done br br anyway this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at time when audiences were moving away from these little black and whites in favor of wide screen spectacles too bad what hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front she deserves at least an honorary oscar from movie industry to which she contributed so much &#39;,
 &#39; this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses his low budget hong kong movies were all fast paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris there is nothing about chan character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star in his hong kong films chan is never dull with the movies being one rapid fire martial arts sequence after another but the protector is lifeless throughout danny aiello isn given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together both have been better in worse movies the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab it wouldn be until the made in canada rumble in the bronx that the west would finally figure out how to make good jackie chan movie &#39;,
 &#39; there was some good build up of suspense throughout the cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget we witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while crocodile is stalking you silence would have been golden here there could have been bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother something tells me there a slight difference in getting beating from your brother than being eaten by mighty 15ft croc you decide throughout the film can seem to find connection or for that matter sympathy with the characters perhaps thats because they don develop one throughout the film character that is there are some occasional good scares when the crocodile sneaks up on the characters overshadowed again by some questionable scenes in one instance we should be terrified by an ear floating in the water but later we sit beside decapitated limbless corpse and only worry about broken finger definite roller coaster of film when it comes to logic &#39;,
 &#39; yes this review may contain spoilers but you ll thank me for it this is the worst film ve seen in quite some time came to this board expecting to see the same response had but inexplicably there are several people who love this film and spacey performance in particular br br some will chastise me for saying it but find kevin spacey acting quite limited despite the world admiration for him felt like was watching meaner version of kevin american beauty role his character in this film is ridiculously overacted all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant br br there are all world trite and boring scenes like when spacey is tearing into whaley about bringing him equal instead of sweat and low somehow suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny but by this time was ready to hit the stop button this is approximately 20 minutes into the film br br what about the faux homage to resevoir dogs whaley proclaims think saw this in movie once as if he going to cut off spacey ear but what does he use to cut him an envelope that right he going to give him paper cuts that has to be one of hollywood all time worst scenes and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with straight face makes it even more appalling br br will admit that didn see the end of this film my dvd mercifully locked up about half hour before the end but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that missed great twist and everything would have made sense well don care what happened in the end because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over the top dialogue even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as did &#39;,
 &#39; the movie storyline is pat and quaint two women travel through the middle east and discover themselves unfortunately if you are looking for movie about the middle east and central asia this is absolutely terrible br br the producers of the film either did no research or were unbelievably lazy when filming it to begin with and most glaringly incorrect the nuristanis as they were known in the thirties and indeed since the 1890s and their forceful conversion by abdul rahman shah of aghnaistan were not nomads in fact they have not been nomads since the aryan invasions of central asia over three milenia ago br br second the city that is filmed as tehran is not tehran which is understandable however the geography of the area around the city could not be more strikingly different than the city of tehran which is surrounded on all side by large mountain range which predominates all of the cities views br br third persian despite the fact it is spoken in iran and afghanistan is never heard in movie when there are native speakers who do not speak in german they speak in arabic the persian guards at the border in fact say to each other ma hadha rujal this is not man and not in mard nist as it would be in persian also the love song between the indian princess and one of the main characters is obviously in spanish while talking in the garden one of the main characters says that the quran uses the words ferdos and jehaan and makes some reference to drugs afterwords these words certainly never appear in the quran as they are persian for paradise indeed ferdos and paradise are very distant cognates between our languages and world respectively though jehaan is admittedly close to jehennan which is hell in arabic when they encounter the nomads in the desert the language spoken is also arabic this despite the fact that there are no native speakers of arabic in iran and afghanistan and its use is primarily religious with some use in education at that time br br when they are stopped in iran before they reach the afghan border the people they encounter are wholly unlike any iranian group their tents are typically bedouin with carpets decorating the walls and high profile in iran it is also extremely uncommon for people to wear turbans unless they are cleric the language spoken is clearly arabic from the initial greeting of ahlan wa sahlan when they do reach kabul the desert they find themselves in is sandy totally unlike the rock dirt that is found in the arid parts of the hindu kush mountain range there is an absence of the light green scrub that covers the ground in the summer and spring the area is also not wholly consumed by the extreme mountains of the mountain range that won its name the indian killers because of its difficult and limiting ground br br in short the story line is the only thing in this movie that holds any water and it is still weak and common place it lacks any real draw to it being merely the tale of two women trying to learning about themselves as they get to nuristan however even that is still born and no real development is felt leaving the characters in the end just where they were in the beginning and nothing has changed except that world war two has broken loose in short this is really bad movie that would have rated at one star except for the good footage of bedouin and the deserts of the levant even if they are misnamed &#39;,
 &#39; the bloodsucker leads the dance what laughable title it so utterly misleading it not surprising that the film makers try and mislead us though because this is one terrible movie br br the story basically involves murder mystery in castle on remote island br br very little happens in this film and when something does wake the viewer from his stupor it invariably is unintentional comedy in the form of atrocious dialogue delivered by hopeless group of voice artists these guys are so bad they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like group of remedial level morons it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal but the voice artists cannot be blamed for the script it a travesty unintentionally funny at best pathetic at worst the story in general is to say the least uneven the women characters are particularly idiotic the men are either creepy or tedious br br the whole enterprise smacks of pure exploitation of the audience it doesn remotely deliver what it promises and even when the murders finally start happening they all occur off screen all we get is few half hearted severed head shots br br few people have said that this movie is giallo cannot agree less with this opinion anyone who enjoys italian thrillers should give this movie wide berth as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it it basically soft core porn film with horror angle but it not very erotic either br br can recommend this to anyone &#39;,
 &#39; man really wanted to like these shows am starving for some good television and applaud tnt for providing these opportunites but sadly am in the minority guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king as brilliant as king writing is the irony is that it simply doesn translate well to the screen big or small with few exceptions very few the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read many people would disagree with this but m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but pale memory of the one they read the reason is simple the average king story takes place in the mind scape of the characters in the story he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view in short king takes the reader places where you can put panavision camera as an audience watching the filmed king we re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to it not too far stretch to claim that one becomes character in king story they read whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed for as long as king writes hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor without any regard to whether or not they should don blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works the task is akin to turning lead into gold or some arcane zen mastery oh well better luck next time &#39;,

 &#39; jessica ghost story is as the name implies ghost story the theme is meant to be horror but comes across closer to comedy br br woman comes who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead this constitutes what this movie attempts to pass off as plot there is really nothing more to it the movie comprises of series of loosely connected scenes involving guy who had an affair with this woman prior to her death br br immediately from the opening scenes this movie has the appearance of straight to dvd effort unlike gems such as vacancy 2 the movie has no sense of direction or creativity and certainly gives straight to dvd movies bad name the direction is as poor as can be with complete lack of suspense scares or tension even the drama elements are hopelessly handled and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera you may have had the misfortune of enduring br br the acting across the board is absolutely abysmal with no one actor involved managing to show even the slightest potential of successful acting career br br many of the individual scenes are incredibly long with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges m not exaggerating br br the only reason give this movie rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the poor acting combined with even worse dialogue made for few unintentional laughs stress the word few in that sentence this is not overall one of the so bad it good movies like camp blood or the nail gun massacre if you want to laugh hysterically watch those movies if you want to see proper horror movie about ghosts watch the legend of hell house the changeling ringu the eye original korean version the grudge one missed call or phone br br advise anyone who has had the good fortune of avoiding seeing jessica ghost story to keep up the good work just forget this movie exists don spare thought for it &#39;,
 &#39; found the documentary entitled fast cheap and out of control to be fairly interesting documentary the documentary contained four mini documentaries about four interesting men each one of these men was extremely involved with his job showing sheer love and enjoyment for one job br br the sad part must say would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked studied they were interesting for about five minutes afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long br br the video was filmed in very creative way though very much enjoyed the film of one thing with voice dub over another it played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music &#39;,
 &#39; got encouraged to watch this film because ve heard good word of it it was supposed to be this thrilling true crime milestone disturbing shocking all that jazz well am disturbed because spent money on it and am shocked that something so god awful actually got released that about it br br this is supposed new look at charles manson family of insane loser junkies and their murders but if this is new look then it probably new as in fresh and totally inept just watching it gave me headache and had to give up trying to make any sense of it or even understand just what the director intended it to be br br suppose should say something about the plot but fact is it was so stupid and incoherent that barely remember if there even was plot at all there was something about manson tape delivered to radio dj or tv producer then an hour of pointless random footage of the family in 69 then the polanski murders looking like bad school play and finally some idiotic part about bunch of skinheads getting drunk and beating the hell out of one another in an alley kid you not and then it ended thank god don ask me to make any sense of that m just recalling what saw the performances were terrible too and how difficult is it to make convincing manson get short skinny scrawny bloke put dirty wig and shaggy beard on him there your manson but this manson doesn even look right he just looks like uh bloke in cheap wig and glued on santa beard painted black br br or maybe that what this film is actually about manson family didn make any sense so this film doesn make any sense either it symbolic yeah right m still so angry at spending money on this stopped my normal lurking on this site and registered just to vote 1 for this film and post this warning that will hopefully prevent others from spending their money on this garbage stay away from it it not even worth renting br br ps the recent us tv production helter skelter got bad reviews here but saw it last month saw the 1976 original too and let me tell you compared to manson family that new helter skelter is brilliant and flawless and was disappointed in it that how bad manson family is it makes flawed and mostly disappointing tv movie look perfect &#39;,
 &#39; when was young was big fan of the naked gun movies but just recently watched the show police sqaud and think its great leslie nielson awesome alan north is cool and who the heck is rex hamilton but anyways it one goofy show br br one of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits think my favorite one is when norberg not j walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame classic br br the only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old when drebin shows cigarette to someone and asks cigarette and the person replies yes know think they used it too many times by whatever br br good acting good gags great show br br 7 10 &#39;,
 &#39; within about 5 minutes in to the film the first fight scene was watching just could help but pointout the lack of tension in the scene the cameras crossing back and forth really shows he had no idea what he was doing well actually the soundtrack shows that the best no its low budget film and your not going to get top 40 songs but at least get music that goes with the scene that isn actually that hard acting well if saw any would gladly let you know the script was so badly written would now surprise me one bit of the guy directing wrote this piece of beep will give the person one 10 10 and that was for the dvd cover because if actually saw before watching this in shop and it was like 10 15 bucks would have bought it why well if you look at the front cover this actually well done you flip over to the back and you see that it has actually won awards now that is very misleading thing because even in small film festival wouldn ever believe in my life that this would win anything all can say is wow if this was the best wouldn want to know what the crap in the film festival was like br br films that are this bad only have one good use and that is for aspiring film maker to use as inspiration films like this are better tools then good films because with good film you almost know off the bat there is good chance you wont make film that good but if you use film like this you can look at all the things they director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes and you have the added plus of looking at this film and saying if piece of beep like this can get made then there is hope of anyone out there &#39;,
 &#39; my mother worked with dennis raider for eleven years not to mention shared an office with him when it was announced he was btk she was shocked the whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the wichita killer ve heard her re tell them many times ve inquired her about lot of things and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to ve read the entire book written about raider wichita is my hometown and was surprised that such thing could happen in kansas br br there was another btk movie on tv not too long ago and thought this one would have been better at portraying dennis killings maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives br br m going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie this is based on my mom portrayal of him all my readings on him and the video tapes ve seen of him talking br br first of all the camera angles were horrible it looked as though it had been shot on home video camera the acting was terrible and couldn even bear to watch it br br dennis raider never had long hair dennis raider was very anal man and was follow the rule book kind of guy he wasn as nice as the movie made him look he was very polite and abrupt business like same goes for his killings as far as we all know if you ve seen his confession in court you can already guess br br and as for the obsession with the slaughter house no never have read or has dennis raider confessed to having problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs in fact he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods yet through out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim faces and acting like he cared about the well being of them br br dennis raider never killed the people that he knew he confessed this but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also br br really don even want to go in to this movie and m already ranting this is not what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of btk this is not what you want to watch if you want good horror movie if you want badly shot half porno with some slaughter scenes served the side then this is your kind of movie &#39;,
 &#39; watched this movie based on the comments of few that said that is was bad but funny but you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced they make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art this is funny at times but annoying for the most part and to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized majority of the events depicted one of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid very impressive but this is just one example and for what its worth the music sucks the acting sucks the two cute girls are annoying the obnoxious guy is annoying the so called handsome lead man is geek and the black girl who fall for him is fool her father is the worst actor have ever seen am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience &#39;,
 &#39; must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out it wasn as epic as musa the warriors and didn develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas simple story elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the japanese in korea in medieval days his counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him the fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch the motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end you might need to watch it again to get all the connections right and me personally loved the end could watch it over and over again maybe little pathetic but real freedom fighter story people can be killed but not the ideas they stand for &#39;,

 &#39; this review may contain spoilers the decline of western civilization what great title eh and of coarse great movie this is the best concert film have ever seen close second being the talking heads movie stop making sense first heard of this movie when waynes world came out in 1992 looked at the director name penelope spheeris and thought cool name what else has he directed thought the first name was pronounced like envelope after some time looking in movie guides came across the critically acclaimed decline and realized penelope was woman my mom corrected me spent 8 years of my life trying to track this down finally saw it on vhs in vancouver where currently reside it was worth the wait this captures the la punk movement very well this is teen angst at it best folks my favourite is the band the germs who need subtitles for the lyrics because darby crash sings so crazy you cannot understand it laughed when saw this the band black flag live in an abandoned church and the band are very intelligent bunch also laughed at the letter some idiot writes in to slash magazine about how we do not need to save the whales there are countless miles of ocean for us to pour toxins in became huge penelope spheeris fan after this and saw all her punk movies dudes was ok and suburbia is cult classic own both of these on vhs she is true underground film maker and love her stuff would have loved to have seen this movie in 1994 when grunge was so popular was big nirvana fan then but alas saw this in 2002 and by that point had grown out of grunge and now listen to crystal method fatboy slim quite change of pace know but what can you do but if you want true depiction of the punk movement this captures it better than anything much better than 1991 the year punk broke this is tough movie to track down but if you get your hands on it rent it even if you don like the music it is an excellent piece of work now days it might be easier to find with dvd being so popular by the way penelope produced little known albert brooks movie called real life which also own very funny stuff in todays reality tv craptacular rent decline highly recommended thanks &#39;,
 &#39; obviously the comments above that fawn over the movie were made by someone who on the crew don recall ever seeing movie that more insulting to the talented actors or the audience watching in my 30 years of watching movies this is the only one have ever walked out of bad humor bad jokes bad gags bad editing bad plot etc br br note to producer it never funny to hunt humans based on race great that you tried to be politically correct by incorporating all races but you re still hunting humans based on race and that sickening &#39;,
 &#39; best movie ever this movie broke my ribs just by the force of laughter but it was well worth it don intend to do summary of this excellent movie just go see it if you have the chance think you will either love it or hate it that the qualities of real cult movie &#39;,
 &#39; oh how we have misfire here film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since w griffith referred to the chinese character in broken blossoms as the yellow man characters so unimaginative and un engaging that it difficult to watch as well as narrative that plods along at such slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this film br br prizzi honor is film that ends up being an absolute post modern disaster in every which way possible the film is messy and senseless disaster that has john huston directing kathleen turner and jack nicholson staring and everybody else filling in the gaps as either dumb stereotypes or supporting characters that weep on phone now and again or bicker with main character prizzi honor is film that falls into genre of neo noir comedy romance action gangster and overall crime â this twinned with its director and cast should be enough to propel it through some sort of story some sort of sequence of good scenes some sort of intelligence in the form of screenplay or something else but no â what we get is nasty and ugly film revolving around nothing at all br br ll give couple of examples of how shoddy this horror show of film actually is firstly the film thinks it a love story and it thinks this for about an hour of its time of my time charley partanna nicholson is an assassin who kills people for family that he works for in new york and yet he resembles his character out of one flew over the cuckoo nest more than an international hit man he meets and falls in love with irene walker turner who is another assassin and they hit it off but as the poor excuse for plot plays out it appears all is not right read that the plot for this film is professional hit man and hit woman fall in love only to discover that they have each been hired to kill the other well yes that true but that actual revelation doesn happen until about twenty minutes to the end nicholson plays partanna like someone with an iq of 60 he walks around seemingly making observations and talking out loud about things he sees he talks like he is either drunk or has more serious problem from within and worse of all we never get the feeling he is an assassin â one really poorly shot assassination early on that actually happens off screen is not enough to suggest this guy is hard bodied best of the best international hit man br br so with main character who is un likable and un realistic we move to the script the first hour and half is just cinematic dead zone with what ever there is to suggest traces of life merely poor conventions partanna slouches around on the phone or in person asking the same things over and over again do marry her do love her what is love what do do and it gets so repetitive it not even able to act as good humour this twinned with the way he always seemed to be on the phone to someone girl called maerose prizzi huston played by director john daughter which served absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever and seemed to be there for laughs as was the scene in which she tells her father about how she slept with partanna and loved it â that got me thinking was this supposed to be funny should be laughing the film felt like smart mafia picture what with its opening scene of wedding alã the godfather and consequential scenes with touch of noir as gangsters police men and assassins were introduced into the film but what we get is something very very different br br the second hour revolves around some sort of kidnap plot right the love and romance is dealt with â maybe the film will kick start was so very wrong with more characters continuously talking very slowly and very deliberately in monotone way we have kidnap scene involving some guy coming out of his office this scene sums the film up everything is briefly planned and then executed in heavy handed and dumb way that just makes it look cheesy we do not get to see them arrive to some dramatic music perhaps they have to get through security to get to the elevators maybe they have to be careful of civilians when they hide in their chosen places and when that random woman steps out of the elevator and the gunshot occurs â the scene isn even edited correctly some suspense some drama do shoot or don i maybe some slow motion as the character has to quick draw before it too late â anything but how it was actually executed prizzi honor continues its monotonous and uninteresting decent into filmic oblivion as it nears its climax it a film where cameras reflect in windows lights reflect in sides of cars and dead chauffeurs blink when nudged prizzi honor is jumbled and messy film that will try the patients of any film goer and don say it was comedy because didn laugh with it â at it is another matter the film is repetitive drawn out and colourless in its vision and scope for originality there is no honour here &#39;,
 &#39; fellowe drama about couple marriage which is threatened by younger third party which interests the wife of the house watson wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled husband who cant control his wife cheating and deals with the issue also like rupert everett lot in his role as william bule the man that watson has the affair with although think emily watson is great actress had bit of problem with the way her character was written did not make her too likable know cheater is not supposed to be likable but some of her actions and things she did had no reasoning behind them the screenplay was perhaps the weak part of this drama although fellowes direction was good and the performances were also quite good this film is better than unfaithful but not masterpiece by any means imdb rating 6 7 my rating 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; as far as cinematography goes this film was pretty good for the mid 50 there were few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus the acting was above average for low budget stinker but the direction was horrible several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non existent the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings also couldn help but think the budget didn allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon honestly it would have been more entertaining if it were worse movie it wasn bad enough to be good bad movie but wasn good enough to be good either get the mst3k version it more fun &#39;,
 &#39; lucio fulci made lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title the godfather of gore while don torture duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds and isn all that gory it certainly gritty and nasty little thriller and for my money the best film that fulci ever made don torture duckling really is head and shoulders above lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci later films everything about this giallo is great the plot focuses on small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes reporter named andrea martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own martelli soon encounters various suspects including sexy young lady named patricia sinister priest and local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them br br while this film may not feature loads of gore it does have two of fulci nastiest sequences to make up for it the nastiest involves woman being brutally slaughtered by group of men in cemetery while the image of man falling from cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs don torture duckling features an absolutely great italian cast barbara bouchet personal favourite of mine is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films tomas millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas florinda bolkan and marc porel the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts lot of care and effort into every scene the story plays out slowly and it always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line there isn a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don torture duckling does climax on high overall it a shame that fulci didn make more films like this don torture duckling is his out and out best work and insist that every giallo fans sees it &#39;,
 &#39; the white warrior is definitely one of if not steve reeves weakest films set in 18th or 19th century russia steve plays cossack warrior who tries to over run mad man russian czar by running up mountain side with his rebel band in goofy looking russian white tunic for the most part the great reeves physique is hidden in goofy knee length tunic with an even more sillier looking russian hat br br the action is rather minimal with only good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great reeves physique this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era with poor results the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene would image reeves regretted making this film but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of baghdad &#39;,
 &#39; bruce almighty is the story of bruce nolan an average man who feels god is messing up his life god confronts him and show bruce the error of his ways of course giving someone god powers could take turn for the worse bruce almighty is good comedy jim carrey is good as always morgan freeman is first rate and seems right at home as god and the cast brings the plot together well the jokes are almost always on target although sometimes they resort bit too much on carrey facial expressions liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed god not only that but also as black man thought this quite well especially with the brilliant freeman there are some hilarious scenes the opening cookie scene for instance others miss the target slightly but still good film 6 7 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; just watched this film this morning and found it to be great showing of the richness of faith babette gave them another way to look at life not replacement but an enhancement she shared all that she had with those who gave what little they had to her see the story of god in here he sent his only son to man man could not possibly give anything that would equal that so for our small sacrifice we are given an ultimate treasure and are transformed because of it in this film the bickering townspeople have so consumed themselves with small interpretation of god babette showed them that life and god can indeed be beautiful in it fullest sense the love that god son showed to man is the love we should show to one another and our lives will be the richer for it even the film is metaphor it seems slow in the beginning but the investment of time and attention to detail is rewarded in the end it was truly feast &#39;,
 &#39; funny sad charming these are all words that floated through my head while was watching this beautiful simple film br br it is rare that movie truly moves me but shall we dance accomplished that with grace to spare gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie viewing history it left me with quiet sense of exultation but with small touch of sadness mixed in br br and the dancing oh yes the dancing even if you are not lover of the art or can put one foot in front of another the steps displayed here will take your breath away and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can it was absolutely enchanting even the parts that show sugiyama touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in humorous child like way and yet this film was not entirely about dancing but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings we witness shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast br br beauty pain emotion all the love and little agonies of life are here expressed with the delicate feeling of fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture br br &#39;,
 &#39; the above line sums it up pretty good the best assets of the comics are it visual gags and word jokes the latter of which are almost impossible to translate which is why the comics are at their best in their original language br br both are quite hard to capture in film which is why those will never be as good as the comics movies are simply different medium than comics with that in mind this movie does surprisingly well in capturing the fun of the comic br br the word gags are bearable and sometimes even funny debouze does an amelie reference have to mention that watched the french version if you don watch the french version or your lack of understanding of the french language limits you to the subtitles the word jokes will probably suck br br the slapstick is okay as well it a very simple form of humor and not really funny when you re older than twelve but it captures the spirit of the comicbooks the other visual jokes are the movie saving grace for the older audience as their often quite funny br br the acting is totally over the top but again that not annoying at all as it captures the spirit of the comicbooks only depardieu and clavier don really overact which might be the reason some people think they didn enjoy their roles didn notice thing on the other hand jamel debouze and especially claude rich turn overacting into an artform it actually fun to watch again fear it wouldn be nearly as funny when the voices are dubbed br br overall not bad movie at all much better than the previous one it not classic and it doesn dethrone the twelve tasks of asterix as my favourite asterix movie but it still worth seeing the french version that is 7 10 &#39;,
 &#39; would label this show as horrendous if it weren for the fact that it on the same network as arrested development because it is on fox and getting renewed while ad got cancelled br br it is absolutely beyond words how atrocious this show actually is but let me try and describe it take an extremely low rate archie bunker and have him spout out humor that would have been out of date if it were on married with children then take great plot lines from ad son has an ugly boring girlfriend and dumb them down so the idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them br br if you watch this will have completely lost respect for you as should your family however if you are fan you should love fox new comedy til death looks like real funny cutting edge stuff mean married couples not getting along brilliant &#39;,
 &#39; robert mitchum stars as clint tollinger in this short but tough western man with the gun tollinger is professional town tamer as in when town needs someone to save itself he is the one who is brought in to do it tollinger latest gig comes by as an accident strolling into town looking for his former fling he stumbles into town being played like puppet by local western gangster but many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired tollinger as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing suddenly high plains drifter seems less original br br man with the gun starts off as an average western tough guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses what starts off as forgettable and run of the mill ends up dark and character centered the entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable mitchum is his usual excellent self here in man with the gun not one of his very best performances mitchum still has his classic and effective tough guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action packed meaningful and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park man with the gun is nice mitchum western and is easily worth one time &#39;,
 &#39; this is more than sat afternoon special exremely well written if very low key there is lot here if you look for it catch the cat companion scout for instance it not only could have been comic book it should have been comic book the comic industry as well as the film publicists missed the boat on this one of the least know really great films great script by john sayles is strong point but the acting is good as well probably the best super hero film ve ever seen short on special effects but long on believability this one a keeper have never seen dvd of this film but used to own vhs version good hunting &#39;,
 &#39; have to say this is the worst movie that have ever watched in my life cannot believe that wasted 10 at blockbuster this movie should be burned and who ever thought of it has issues who ever actually spent money to make this movie was insane this movie has terrible actors and some of the scenes make absolutely no sense well the whole movie doesn make sense also the part where those men come into the diner department of national securities that happened to be the worst part of the film how dare they say frank sinatra name in vain also what is up with those glasses when the guy and girl are in the car and she drinks water you can totally tell that she isn even drinking also what is up with the freaky dinner guy and everyone knows that you don stab tires you slash them &#39;,
 &#39; have never read the bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what ve gathered it will be interesting when finally do read it and will my comments will be based purely on the film as soon as saw the trailer knew had to see it and was so excited but when finally did was so disappointed it hurt this is because the movie itself felt so amateurish the actors were not well cast though robards and pryce are both good actors just not here the kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters clothes say the lines and make the faces the set and props were cheap and unrealistic the direction was surprisingly bad was so surprised at the awfulness of it that had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done the editing was cut and paste and the plot screenplay was just that as well even though the author had been involved himself irony the building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came br br ve read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it what hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing it had so much potential unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story &#39;,
 &#39; have to admit am prejudiced about my vote on this film but have strong reasons as know some of the true history that was given the hollywood treatment here edna ferber novel upon which this is based is from an era where real names can be used in way this film is all smoke mirrors even though it was released in 1946 it was filmed shortly after casablanca ingrid bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as brunette br br she plays beautiful woman who is trying to trade on her beauty to get rich husband today that is gold digger but in this social era she is desirable the kind of woman who makes all the men want her all the old snooty society types talk of her avoid her while wishing they were her ingrid is at her best plays this role well br br some sympathy for ingrids character is raised in the new orleans section of this film as she manages to get decent belated tomb for her scandalized mother as part of the settlement by her relatives to get her to leave new orleans the snooty family of relatives there are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town br br gary cooper is good in this film though he already appears to be aging bit to play dashing texan bachelor gambler he pulls it off well considering that handicap which he appeared older than he was due to his real life chain smoking flora robison as ingrid maid got nominated for an oscar as supporting actress in this film jerry austin as cupidor was over looked in many ways for his role but is the only comic relief in the film does it well br br when the film moves to saratoga it depicts accurately how important saratoga was in that era like the sequence when bergman walks to the saratoge spring to get some of the sulfur water which everyone considered so healthy then when she drinks some she forces herself not to make face and comments how good it is that she must have more br br the real history is the railroad battle which really occurred on the rail line in tunnel new york which is the actual saratoga trunk the film title is derived from this battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for andrew carnagie p morgan the line was the economic key to the country in 1869 connecting coal country the east coast the references to it are throughout the film are very real there is even some dialog describing carnagie as scot though the reference is vague unfamiliar to anyone not knowing the history around the battle br br the railroad line the railroad tunnel in tunnel new york zip code 13848 still exist although the film was shot in california the real tunnel is about 1 mile long it is still part of key freight line today years after this occurred grew up there gary cooper line in the film while he is riding the train into the tunnel is right it is still mighty pretty country &#39;,
 &#39; this film was adapted from the well known sutra on journey to the west where monk with his three students seek out to find long lost book with regards to the teaching of buddha br br though this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made according to the legend it did however managed to bring in romance and fun filled humorous scene br br this real objective of this movie revolves around more on the monk who were primarily saved from being eaten by demonic flying creatures one of his student the monkey god managed to get him out from the battle in the nick of time but were in turn captured by the demons and cast into the deep throat of dragon locked up in that particular dungeon br br the monk awoke in small village where he found mei yan the so called ugly serpent daughter who fell in love over him at first sight though ugly she did not let her appearance be casted aside from getting to him however quest for rescuing his three students soon turn out to be filled with obstacles and each of which turned out to get worse with mei yan following the monk problems crept deeper and this is where conflicts between the relationship gets worse br br the rest of the tale would be left at your own disposal but suffice to say this film does not depict the typical storyline of the book it is more for those who wants to seek out for funny and light picture of what journey to the west and the love obstacles really mean br br towards the very end the whole summary could be described with only one word and that is love the monk went to show the heavenly gates the celestial palace and buddha himself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and deemed fit as the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers br br wonderfully created and funny acts awaits those who buys this ticket there would be of course no regrets at least from my side and those who were with me at the cinema that day watching the same film &#39;,
 &#39; let me first state that enjoy watching bad movies it funny how some of these films leave more of lasting impression than the truly superb ones this film is bad in disturbingly malicious way this vehicle for sam mraovich delusional ego doesn just border on talentless ineptitude it has redefined the very meaning of the words this should forever be the barometer for bad movies sort of the mendoza line for film mr mraovich writes directs and stars as blunt object arthur sailes battling scorned wives and the christian forces of evil as he and his partner ben dead behind the eyes sheets struggle for marital equality as libertarian believe gays should have right to get married ben arthur do more harm to that cause than an army of homophobes the portrayal of all things christian are so ugly and ham fisted trademark mraovich that you can possibly take any of them seriously arthur brother victor the bible toting jesus freak is so horribly over the top evil effeminately gay that you have to wonder how he was cast in this role that because sam multitasking mraovich was also casting director the worst of it all is sam mraovich himself when you think leading man do the words pasty balding and chubby come to mind sam also delivers lines like domino pizza cold and usually wrong the final tally you suck at writing directing acting and casting that the ed wood quadruple crown congratulations you horrible little man &#39;,
 &#39; essentially undistinguished movie that mysteriously is directed by one of the golden era major talents fritz lang even with the stellar names of lang walter pidgeon joan bennett and george sanders be prepared for ludicrous storyline bad acting patently phony sets and miscasting for transparency sake have to admit am an ardent non admirer of walter pidgeon who was lucky to have found niche at the artificial dream factory of mgm and somehow worked in secondary roles supporting greer garson and others he is wildly miscast acting in chipper 30s ray milland madcap comedy tone in role where his life is in danger and he is in hiding joan bennett cockney accent is excessive but her lacquered hair perfect makeup and classy outfit belies street wise cockney slum girl george sanders is incapable of bad acting but disappears after the preposterous opening finds pidgeon somehow pretending to shoot adolph hitler surprising for fritz lang is the unevenness of tone found the film wavered uneasily between occasional moments of suspense thriller surrounded by light hearted comedic interplay hitchcock totally reversed the ratio using comic relief to occasionally pace the suspense there is reason this film is unknown it didn serve or propel anybody career or reputation and is forgotten because it a surprisingly bad film from such pedigreed group &#39;,
 &#39; cyclone is piece of dreck with little redeeming value even on the so bad its entertaining front friend of mine took the tape from an overflowing st vincent depaul clothes bin okay that may be little bit dodgy but it was meant to be clothes bin not crappy old vhs bin something the less fortunate members of our society don really need to make their lives better it could be considered mercy watching movie like cyclone would really only add to their problems anyway the basic premise of woman with super powerful motorcycle that it armed to the teeth with rockets and lasers isn even properly exploited the two high speed chase sequences involve vehicles travelling at less than hair raising speeds of around 40 kmph and super fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by crappy old station wagon is not that awe inspiring when you get down to it there is only one scene where the bikes goofy weaponry is used at the film climax and it is laughably ineffectual or just laughable when it is this includes laser beams that look like they should be coming out of the hands of an evil wizard in cheesy eighties sword and sorcery that produced large bursts of flame which seem to have no noticeable effect on their targets even when they hit directly the rest of the movie is just tedious hard to watch filler lots of bad actors yes even combs and landau suck in this most of whom seem like they have been lifted from the set of porno movie stand around exchanging really bad dialogue in desperate attempt to pus forward the barely coherent plot there are few badly staged fight sequences and some excruciatingly unfunny comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of the motor cycle repair shop comedy of the sub benny hill horny old man can stop staring at the female leads chest variety basically the money scenes involving the bike actually doing stuff are few and lame and the rest is clunky filler material skip it &#39;,
 &#39; cinderella is one of the most beloved of all disney classics and it really deserves its status based on the classic fairy tale as told by charles perrault the film follows the trials and tribulations of cinderella good girl who is mistreated by her evil stepmother and equally unlikable stepsisters when royal ball is held and all eligible young women are invited read the king wants to get the prince to marry cinderella is left at home whilst her stepmother takes her awful daughters with her but there is fairy godmother on hand br br the story of cinderella on its own wouldn be able to pad out feature so whilst generally staying true to the story otherwise the fairly incidental characters of the animals whom the fairy godmother uses to help get the title character to the ball become cinderella true sidekicks the mice jaq and gus are the main sidekicks and their own nemesis being the stepmother cat lucifer their antics intertwine generally with the main fairy tale plot and are for the most part wonderful admittedly the film does slow down bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the stepsisters depart for the ball but after this slowdown the film really gets going again and surprisingly since cinderella is the most worn down story of all time probably ends up as one of the most involving disney stories br br the animation and art direction is lovely all of the legendary nine old men animated on this picture and mary blair colour styling and concept art she also did concept art and colour styling for alice in wonderland peter pan the three caballeros and many many others manage to wiggle their way on screen the colours and designs are lovely especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes as well as in those pretty little moments here and there br br overall cinderella ranks as one of the best disney fairy tales and comes recommended to young and all that embodies the disney philosophy that dreams really can come true &#39;,
 &#39; might contain spoilers br br ok lets conclude this movie in one word bad two words really bad now why do think that let me explain br br guttenberg leads special ops team consisting of four persons that get assigned to retake an lethal virus after some arms dealer stole it from lab they do this by attacking the arm dealers in mid flight and somehow gets back the virus after some fighting however suspicions arise about guttenberg because one of the terrorist knew his name after debriefing the team members get attacked by unknown persons and everyone starts to suspect everyone else is involved after deciding they cant trust their bosses they decide to once again steal the virus and try to lure out the possible attackers br br in theory this is plot that could have worked in low budget movie that just aims to be aired on tv however the plot is compromised and the movie ruined in several accounts firstly the plot is totally predictable and it is not fun to know how the movie is going to end after three minutes second the acting is really bad or the actors are directed to act as dummys there aren many emotions change of facial expressions at all etc was especially disappointed in guttenberg that believe can do so much more but fails completely in an attempt to be rough action hero in addition though am not by any means any expert on the subject totally believe could assemble better covert ops team by picking up five strangers and train them for week this seems to be theme in the movie to do things as stupid and unprofessionally as possible this go for good guys bad guys and bystanders as well then sincerely doubt the scientific and technical consultants if any of the film for example have poured liquid nitrogen over my hand and didn break instantly br br don know how to conclude this really but lets say that this movie has predictable plot bad acting and they seem to be amateurs in whatever the do sorry can be any nicer than that do not watch this movie it is not even so bad it is funny 2 10 &#39;,
 &#39; ll give writer director william gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill conceived thriller good argument for not wasting money subscribing to hbo let alone buying dvds based on cover art and blurbs pedestrian dennis hopper and game richard grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad the dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst no tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely film best seen as trailer feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing good for late night zoned out viewing only you have been warned &#39;,
 &#39; laugh clown laugh released in 1928 stars the legendary lon chaney as circus clown named tito tito has raised foundling young and beautiful loretta young to adulthood and names her simonetta tito has raised the girl in the circus life and she has become an accomplished ballerina while chaney gives his usual great performance could not get past the fact that tito now well into middle age has the hots for the young simonetta although he is not her biological father he has raised her like daughter that kind of ick factor permeates throughout the film tito competes for simonetta affections with young and handsome count luigi nils asther simonetta clearly falls for the young man but feels guilt about abandoning tito out of loyalty not romantic love the whole premise of the film is ridiculous and find it amazing that no one in the film tells tito what stupid old fool he is being until he reveals it himself at the end the film is noteworthy only because of loretta young who would go on to have great career while adore chaney brilliance as an actor this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy &#39;,
 &#39; m sorry guys all who thought this film could be something great m afraid you would be disappointed br br the standard the movie wanted to set is completely ruined by some very simple plot so simple that the movie is not evolving until the end asked myself if the plot wasn about the action but about the main character played by mickey rourke but found that the character was inconsistent either he is professional killer or some guilt haunted brother but both don go together because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself now joseph gordon levitt is good looking actor but he played his character little unnatural didn believe his acting it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn provide and he didn have to because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough the only one whose acting was great was diane lane if not her would give this movie 1 star br br in conclusion expected to see some well played movie and some interesting plot and completely blew it with my high expectations &#39;,
 &#39; this dvd is missing its calling as heineken coaster this is great example of why no one should ever go see sequel with different director writer than the original two hours of this turkey left me begging for exorcist 2 reruns br br no legitimate laughs not one decent scare the script was just mess and felt bad for the actors who had to perform it they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something br br the original was makeup effects landmark so naturally the producers of the sequel thought it would be great idea to to scrap makeup fx and do cg werewolves instead these cg werewolves had me laughing lot harder than any of the comedy it was just total miss if ya want night entertainment go rent the original again or go take film class and make your own horror film you re bound to do better than these fools did &#39;,
 &#39; group of young filmmakers with virtually no budget set out to make something clever and original and while there is bit of originality and some skilled drawing in this slacker puppet show take on dante inferno there is nothing especially clever dante divine comedy was brilliant piece of social commentary this film is vaguely moralistic student film with pretensions to high art br br suspect those who loved this film were those readily amused by the sophomoric pokes at some icons of the political and or religious right and that those who hated it took offense at seeing their favored icons poked be that as it may few of those pokes actually rose to the level of satire br br the high point of the movie is sudden outbreak of schoolhouse rock on the subject of lobbying and the revolving door it really shame that the entire film couldn have been musical that would have stripped away great deal of the annoying film school pretentiousness and added far stronger element of fun &#39;,
 &#39; this is great small film say small because it doesn have hundred guns firing or dozen explosions as in john woo film great performances by roy scheider and the three bad guys john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of yarn than washing machine instead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens wonderful ending very positive never read the elmore leonard book but it can be much different from the film because it feels like m watching an elmore leonard movie &#39;,
 &#39; m glad some people liked this but hated this film it had very good idea for story line but that where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly made br br it had some interesting plot points but they were just skipped over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and ditch the dross instead it was what going on 5 seconds later they tell you br br this film had no suspense and was bored from start to end just wanted it to finish br br go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end &#39;,
 &#39; in many ways the filmic career of independent film making legend john cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like alfred hitchcock the consummate studio director where hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally where every element in hitchcock shot is composed immaculately cassavetes cared less for the way scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally hitchcock tales were always plot first narratives with the human element put in the background cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films if some things did not make much sense logically so be it br br one can see this even from his very first film 1959 shadows filmed with 16mm hand held camera on shoe string budget of about 40 000 in manhattan with cassavetes acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film the story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling manhattanites benny ben carruthers trumpeter and no account hugh hugh hurd washed up singer and lelia lelia goldoni the younger sister of both the film three main arcs deal with hugh failures as nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager rupert rupert crosse benny perambulations in an about manhattan with his two no account pals and lelia lovelife first with white boy tony anthony ray who does not realize light skinned lelia race even after bedding her then with stiff and proper davey davey jones who may be misogynist br br in the first arc nothing much happens except dark skinned hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts he dreams of making it big in new york or even paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows he a marginal talent at best that rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work but this is the least important of the three arcsâ while this film is better overall than say martin scorsese first film decade later who that knocking at my door another tale of failed romance and frustrated new yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments acting wise nor cinematographically that that film has it also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era manhattan exteriors at ground level is gem to relive while shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near great film parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willy nilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle all in all it a very sloppy job especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as cassavetes proved that as director at least in his first film he was good actor the only reason for anyone to see shadows is because cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives clue as to his later working style br br the national film registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as culturally significant this is all in keeping with the credo of art cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote ve never seen an exploding helicopter ve never seen anybody go and blow somebody head off so why should make films about them but have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way ve seen people withdraw ve seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and ve myself done all these things so can understand them what we are saying is so gentle it gentleness we have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems that this film is culturally significant is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being artistically significant it is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives &#39;,

 &#39; at the beginning of the film you might double check the dvd cover and re read the synopsis couple of times but no worries it not memoirs of geisha that you purchased just movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be still the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie as it shows how in the year 1840 samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery he decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara kiri ritual suicide through disembowelment cut to present day when the american ambassador in japan welcomes befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and half century ago from then onwards this becomes seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional let start with the good aspects namely the original japanese setting and the presence of the delicious susan george who is my all time favorite british horror wench well together with britt eckland linda hayden and ingrid pitt the bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter the restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff the spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into susan ravishing booty and transforming her into lewd seductress in this possessed state she even lures the american ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of high society diner party full of prominent guests so strictly spoken it not really evil that dwells in the house just trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long dead hands obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening especially since the light blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in ghostbusters the house where evil dwells is probably the least scary ghost movie ever throughout most of the running time you ll be wondering whether director kevin connor who nevertheless made the excellent horror films motel hell and from beyond the grave intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over the top like motel hell maybe but then again everyone in the cast continues to speak his her lines with straight and sincere face so guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed the house where evil dwells is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it doesn even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning am fully aware of how shallow it sounds but the two scenes in which susan george goes topless are the only true highlights well those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over sized spiders or are they crabs in the daughter bedroom how totally random and irrelevant was that if you ever decide to give this movie chance notwithstanding its bad reputation make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep br br trivia note for horror buffs keep an eye open for the demon mask that was also pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant japanese horror classic onibaba &#39;,

 &#39; if this film had budget of 20 million d just like to know where the money went monkey could make better cgi effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage although must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really really cool on an original play station 1 game and early pc games from the mid 90s if game had ever been made what puzzles me is where did the money go pendragon films could have made great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras la george lucas circa 1975 83 and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing or ruining in this case for about the same 20 million this is quite possibly the worst film ever made would rather sit through 24 hour repeat screening of ishtar than watch this film again hated it completely regress say this is the worst film ever made because unlike other bad movies like plan 9 or killer tomatoes or santa claus conquers the martians these are films that are so bad you have special place in your heart for them you love them there is no love for this film and no place in my dvd library for it sold it to guy for dollar m betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew shame on you pendragon films want my money back &#39;,
 &#39; good boring or bad it good worth your money if you can spare it for ticket sure better than the trailer makes it seem yes oddly br br there isn much to the script guards working at armored truck company move vast amounts of cash guards see opportunity to retire as millionaires one of them is too honest to go along with it all and well laid plan goes to hell br br this could have been poorly executed reservoir dogs ripoff but the skill of the cast and the director ability to make just about anything tense pull it out of that realm and put it onto solid footing &#39;,
 &#39; my rating refers to the first 4 seasons of stargate sg 1 which are wonderfully fresh creative and addicting when the cast stepped through the gate you never knew what lay on the other side starting around season 5 the show took different focus still good but different br br the series follows the adventures of team of humans and one alien who regularly venture into planetary transport device called the stargate the backstory of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie stargate in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in egypt br br the episodes are light innocent and easy to watch and very creative many of the inventive stories could easily have been made into great sci fi movies of their own what happens next was always unpredictable br br the characters on which the show rests are also well defined and brilliantly performed their tone is serious but the dialog is flowered with incredible wit and humor they are simply fun to watch br br starting somewhere around season 5 the series started to evolve into continuing storyline based on fighting single foe the goa uld then the ori the plots become more complex lot more political strategic oriented and interdependent the characters were still as great as ever but the show was different in nature br br one thing that must be mentioned is to watch the episodes that commemorated the 100th and 200th episodes they are simply can miss shows they exhibit the creative and wildly humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons br br if you are sci fi fan watch few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you ll likely be hooked if you like evolving story lines between two opposing sides you have 10 seasons of shows to look forward to &#39;,
 &#39; idea is great spoiled big time by the judges br br why make fun of people if what the inventors say is true and as most of them say they spent their life saving on the invention the minimum is to reject the idea without making fun out of the people br br also it shows when they want to accept an idea by the crier that they added to the judges br br the only one respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right of the table he is respectable person br br of course the english snob who claims to be business man wearing suite doesn make you one pal br br last but not least the big guy who sits between the english and the crier wake up man the is no job called and inventor for you to call yourself one an inventor is an attribute not job man br br think they wanted to add someone like simon from the american idol they thought it worked there it can work here as well the context is different and the idea is totally different br br it is good idea and they could have done good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their act and attitude br br just stop making fun of the people &#39;,
 &#39; hi m friend of werewolf movies and when saw the title of darkwolf hitting the shelves was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least althou wonder why haven heard of it before br br first of all the movie starts with tits lots of tits tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to who cares about werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots br br so about the mysterious darkwolf character little spoilers ahead but who really cares he your average everyday biker not even super tough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than you ve ever faced before just by describing her tattooed biker type of guy pretty original even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes special effect mean my god that lets plant red dots on eyes with computer effect has been used since the seventies it looks plain ugly here and don get me started with the werewolf 3d cgi as said before like an bad and old video game br br and finally as do like werewolf films like said they prettymuch always build werewolf legend of their own darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline but it almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts random slashing which just doesn make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they aren even gonna play by them aplus the wolf point of view shots are made with sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls just add growling noises and you ve got super werewolf effect the gore is partially ok but when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesn do the trick for me br br truly who gives money to make these heaps of junk straight to video horrortitles they aren even funny kind of bad movies just sad &#39;,
 &#39; had noticed this movie had been on cinemax lot lately so this morning decided to watch it had just finished the infiltrator which is great movie and thought this looked good as well from the description the cable had atleast this film was awful it slow the pacing is horrible it feels as tho it lasts 4 hours there no real plot to speak of agh how can anyone say anything good about this movie rickman is good but he always is the other two characters work well but there no real story to support any of it after 2 hours and you sitting there wondering what on earth is going on where on earth is the plot it ends with surprise that frankly just made me sick don bother with this one &#39;,
 &#39; wow did this episode start on stooooopid premise the enterprise is chugging along when all of the sudden abraham lincoln is floating around in space and welcomes the enterprise is it just me or is this really lame brained idea lincoln comes aboard and they welcome them abe suggests they beam down to some barren planet where they meet other famous dead folks both good and evil it seems that really cheesy looking rock monster has assembled team of good and evil people to battle it out for supremacy the whole thing seems really daffy and inherently unfair as the good side is saddled with surak vulcan who makes gandhi seem like rambo despite totally awful premise the action is pretty good and it great to see overhead shots of obvious doubles fighting it out in this grudge match but don mistake this for high art or deep sci fi the bottom line is that the series was on its last legs as first run series and this really looked like they dusted off this turkey and filmed it regardless of the absurdity of the premise &#39;,
 &#39; all the kids aged from 14 16 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it feel very sad kids can see what good movie is and what bad movie is this was one of the worst movies saw in months every scene you see in this movie is copy from another movie and the end it an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with decent en for such stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when you ll be scared br br when the movie was finished and turned to my friend and told bit to loud him that this was total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day could make an oscar with home video of my goldfish if only use the right marketing &#39;,
 &#39; this film was on last week and although at that time of the day around 6pm the quality of the movies is almost never good at least here on mexican tv couldn switch the tv off the story about madelene moore really touches you she doesn come across as very sympathetic character at first but seeing the whole film you just want her so succeed this film really leaves you thinking and think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film but this was great great acting compliments to brooke hope to see her in another film soon &#39;,
 &#39; have had the opportunity to catch this independent film and was impressed with it despite the lack of excitement in the plot the acting was very good by everyone involved amy madigan played the part of guilt ridden mother who is tired yet well intentioned and determined to make up for her younger daughter condition yet in the process she has neglected her older sister who is more interested in playing with her savant syndrome sibling and living in world of escapism br br the men in the movie are very powerful in their secondary roles christopher lloyd in very understated role shows us why he has such versatility he plays teacher who is dedicated to his profession and literature research yet starved for meaningful relationship he and madigan connect very well in their scenes together yet both know nothing more can come from their friendship their wordless goodbye is nothing short of brilliant an acting lesson for aspiring performers br br and in small role fred savage is fun to watch br br you can tell why this movie was based on play it probably very good on stage on screen it not particularly exciting but it nonetheless very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties &#39;,

 &#39; have seen the sea within today and loved it the actors of the movie are wonderful specially javier bardem of course but thought that belã rueda would have better role lola dueã as clara segura and specially mabel rivera perform excellent interpretations and cannot forget celso bugallo and joan dalmau brother and father of the protagonist br br there are two technical aspects loved very much aguirresarobe photography and the score by amenã bar himself liked the song negra sombra dark shadow by luz casal with music of carlos nãºã ez br br in short think that the spanish academy should choose the sea within in order to compete in the oscar awards liked other spanish productions such as almodã³var bad education but amenã bar film is much better than them the sea within deserves all the awards &#39;,
 &#39; m not huge fan of lucio fulci films most of his 80s gore films had their moments but often came across as second rate dario argento imitations with the exception of the entertaining zombi which was george romero imitation didn really enjoy them know italian horror often disregards the plot but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards this is why don torture duckling surprised me its actually very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery its possibly the best giallo ever made only seriously rivaled by dario argento entries into the genre and unlike fulci previous giallo lizard in woman skin this never drags br br fulci direction here is quite good he keeps the story moving at good pace and maintains the viewer interest throughout also the conclusion to the mystery comes as complete surprise to the audience plus he adds some clever touches such as the upbeat soul music during particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence overall the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story the acting is good for the most part also full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout the only weak link is florinda bolkan whose performance is just far too over the top its the only laughable aspect of the film don torture duckling definitely comes with my recommendation and may be good introduction to the giallo subgenre as whole 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; this film without doubt is one of the worst have seen it was so boring that simply could not wait for it to end talked my girlfriend into watching it after this site had good reviews and after even 30 mins in she looked at me as if to say your nuts the scenery was as boring as the film with nothing but driving around in the car looking at the wind blowing bits of bush around the acting was un inspiring and the film was simply waste of what have been good idea into waste of dvdr br br guy pierce should have stuck to neighbours as at least he washed his hair all he done was talk on his phone but yet sold nothing as salesman he would have been sacked weeks before his girlfriend once in coyote ugly should have remained dancing on the bar as at least she looked hot in that br br the guy who played vincent those who watched know was so annoying with his phone calls that any normal person would have drove to his house and hit him with bit of 4 by 2 br br do not on this earth know what anyone liked about it actually want people to watch this to suffer the torture went through &#39;,
 &#39; unlike another user who said this movie sucked and that olivia hussey was terrible disagree br br this movie was amazing olivia hussey is awesome in everything she in yeah she may be older now because many remember her from romeo and juliet but she wonderful br br this story line may be used quite often but it a unique movie and ll fight back on anyone who disagrees enjoyed this movie just as much as have any other olivia hussey movie olivia my girl and love her work br br saw this for the first time on saturday 4 14 07 and fell in love with it not only because it an olivia movie but because of it unique story line and wonderful direction &#39;,
 &#39; have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind the trauma the suspense is just amazing ended so wound up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it and relating it to reality movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don forget those that make you doubt your reality problem could be the quality but that doesn bring down the essence of the movie br br the idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer just totally loved it so many clues and twitches and puzzles one of the best movies ever hands down &#39;,
 &#39; small town is attacked by horde of bloodthirsty vampires the only hope is lone avenger and group of ragtag survivors br br released in 1993 darkness garnered something of cult following upon release it easy to see why it loaded and mean freaking loaded with gore and it energy and enthusiasm like that found in other no budget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of ravensback is actually rather infectious br br while that may be true that sadly not enough to save it the film was shot on super 8 so the image is grainy and dark making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet also grating is the soundtrack made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal while one isn expecting oscar worthy performances the acting is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened br br in the end m sure fans of no budget gorefests will love this everyone else though will wish there was little more meat on the ribs &#39;,
 &#39; can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst laurel hardy for me it isn as close to as bad as air raid wardens and the bullfighters but there are some definite huge flaws in it the film is set up to show laurel and hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio hardy is funny as the prancing lead of london bridge dance surrounded by 20th century fox starlets while in the next room laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing ballerina outfit clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor leading to predicable gag where hardy ends up the looser then in come the racketeers now selling insurance covering up their protection racket one of them is very young and handsome robert mitchum but no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance they are arrested br br this is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio the rest of the film is devoted to laurel and hardy support of wealthy patron trudy marshall and her inventor boyfriend robert bailey they first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents matt briggs and margaret dumont and hopeful suitor allan lane whom we can tell right off is no good swine this leads to briggs hidden bar being revealed to tea totaling dumont and gag where rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into pond below when bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun pandemonium ensues the dead pan butler announces to case and dumont that their house is on fire br br later hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get laurel to break leg to do so there is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman after being arrested their licenses would have been revoked laurel ends up getting off bus which had been abandoned by the driver over supposedly rabid dog only frosting covered cake devouring toto look alike or possibly the actual pooch causing oliver to end up on huge beach roller coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks roller coaster gags can be exciting as evidenced in abbott and costello go to hollywood and this one is amusing but anticlimactic br br as the story wraps up all of these gags seem to have no point giving the impression that this was simply series of one reelers put together to make full length feature hopefully part of double bill h as ve mentioned in other reviews of their later films had lost much of their luster after leaving hal roach employ but surprisingly here they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year had the gags not been as amusing as was the case with some of their other films this surely would have ranked 2 as opposed to 3 &#39;,
 &#39; sadly it was misguided this movie stunk from start to finish it was hard to watch because used to watch clarissa explains it all every day on nickelodeon loved her then the next thing found she did spread in maxim and she was gorgeous haven really heard anything about her until watched this movie on accident couldn believe she would even let something like this be seen with her name all over it everything about it was wrong but it still looked like someone somewhere in the team was trying really really hard to save sunk ship too bad hope she continues to act and would love to see her with real cast in real movie &#39;,
 &#39; if you have beloved actors peter falk rip torn george segal and bill cobbs you don need billy burke coolio or any other distractions massive talent is totally wasted in three days to vegas with the blame falling squarely on the script my neighbor vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie if you want to see how to utilize veteran cast with good script check out the crew there really are no redeeming factors here and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is crime wanted to like it but the shallow script cheats the audience by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with merk &#39;,
 &#39; rock star 2001 out of four br br by blake french br br rock star is the story of nobody who becomes propelled into fame only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it we have seen all this before in better movies but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with brutally honest and insightful edge it garners recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere the script by crazy beautiful director john stockwell portrays the hard core universe with memorable images it doesn explain what it is about it shows us br br rock star originally titled metal god stars mark wahlberg as chris izzy cole pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming bobby beers the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group steel dragon although chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called blood pollution instead of writing his own songs he insists on performing only those by steel dragon and only in the exact way they perform them his group becomes irritated with chris obsessions and gives him the boot br br tthis devastates chris as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend emily jennifer aniston from tv friends he then receives phone call it the steel dragon band they have seen chris tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer in an instant chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star unfortunately it not as rewarding as he expected br br ta true story inspired the rock star concept an ohio supply salesman tim ripper owens really did replace rob halford the lead singer in judas priest after initially singing for tribute band the rest of the film is probably fiction although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands the film details the various ordeals of being rock star it explores the aspects of touring personality differences the danger of drug abuse and violence struggling relationships sexual freedom dishonesty and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high br br have seen all of mark wahlberg movies and this is the first that has earned my affection wahlberg former singer model has made movies like fear boogie nights three kings and most recently tim burton lacking remake planet of the apes am starting to admire the young actor more and more although he has not performed in many successful films he has taken many chances and done variety of roles rock star is his best film to date can think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed chris cole struggles and aspirations wahlberg truly makes rock star rock br br jennifer aniston lights up the screen as well she creates chemistry rich relationship with chris that induces audience participation it tragic of what happens to their relationship we care about these characters great deal br br during the film concert scenes director stephen herek who also directed holy man and the live action version of 101 dalmatians creates gripping atmosphere he captures the scenes with an intense urgency and raw unmistakable energy the musical numbers provide the film with the best most involving scenes br br unfortunately herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout at the three quarters mark he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it in almost famous much better film about rock and roll there is certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes here it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion br br the message comes bit too late and suddenly in the story the film turns into morality tale that wants to provide us with sappy destination the filmmakers might as well stop everything appear on screen and say now audience the moral of the story isâ we understand the theme but it too instantaneous the personal discovery for chris must be gradual br br fortunately all of this happens in the last twenty five minutes of the film hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty five minutes of reasonably good feature rock star is not great movie see almost famous if you want remarkable film about rock and roll but for marky mark it a turning point in his career br br &#39;,
 &#39; just found out before writing this review that komodo vs cobra and another movie called curse of the komodo were both directed by the same guy jim wynorski that might explain why they are films of nearly identical premises they both feature military governed island colonel whose concerned more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees people racing to get to chopper that is conveniently lying in field somewhere on the island and giant komodo dragons created through genetic experiments running amok what differences are there well the intruders on the island are now capitalists wanting to expose the government secret and there a giant cobra on the island as well hence the title komodo vs cobra even though the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to the story komodo vs cobra is more or less what you expect given its title and its channel origin the sci fi channel although every now and again you will find one that for one reason or another may appeal to you liked movie called komodo hardly doubt this one will br br komodo vs cobra is not only boring film but it also one of the least enthusiastic sci fi flicks ve seen in long time in some of these movies there is an air to them that indicates the filmmakers were giving at least certain level of effort but see very little here that indicated again by it just being rehash of curse of the komodo the cgi for the monsters look as if they came straight out of second rate video game the cinematography and misc en scene is poor the acting ranges from passable to poor the action scenes are dull and then there are some parts that are frankly put unforgivably bad see lot movies where person will shoot gun many times without reloading and can deal with this but in this movie where michael parã takes single thirty eight handgun and fires it approximately fifty times nonstop without reloading onceâ well at first laughed but even then it just became tiring that would be the action monster appears people scream parã fires nonstop without reloading his gun once throughout the entire picture and somebody gets eaten br br komodo vs cobra is very bad movie the only thing in the movie that is worth mentioning in charitable manner is an actress named michelle borth who is not only very beautiful but surprisingly strong performer even with the trashy dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the screenplay she was given michelle borth managed to pull off surprisingly good performance and it just appalls me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in film as junky as this she obviously took it for the paycheck but it won boost her career any m afraid &#39;,
 &#39; yes it feels and for the most part plays like an after school special for slightly more adult audience alright maybe teen audience but add in bill murray already showing some dramatic as well as his usual comedic talent nice supporting cast and an unexpected sweetness about growing up and remembering those great or not so great days at summer camp and you get heartwarming funny sleeper hit br br it does get little too smarmy for its own good but that is also one of its charms when you hear the title meatballs and see the poster you expect teenage sex romp but what you get is sentamental yet sometimes sexy look back at those formative years at summer camp the sentamentality and the remberances of simpler times reminds me of christmas story which also love the rememberances of summer camp were never so well stated the only movie ve seen that comes close is indian summer which like almost as much as meatballs and also stars matt craven let hope he completes the trilogy maybe he could come back for return of the meatballs and bring some dignity back to the franchise meatballs 2 through 4 bare no resemblence to the original classic br br meatballs is easily on my top 10 guilty pleasures of all time not really guilty either it a wonderful little film that always makes me smile &#39;,
 &#39; okay so there is front view of checker taxi probably late 1930s model it has the great triangular shaped headlights there also is desoto cab in this black and white character driven almost musical love gone wrong story br br the real pleasure here is the look at 1940s room interiors and fashions and hotel elevators the hair styles male and female are gorgeous if dolly parton had victor mature hair she could have made it big there is an artist loft that would be the envy of every andy warhol wannabe br br if you watch this expecting great casablanca storyline or sound of music oom pah pah you will be disappointed there is nice little story beneath the runway model approach in this film br br my copy on dvd with another movie for 1 was very viewable the title sequence was cute but not up there with mad mad mad mad world or the pink panther this was an rko movie but it did not have the nice airplane logo that rko used to use br br liked victor mature in one million c and sampson and delilah and especially in violent saturday see if you can find that one he was wonderful in the comedy with peter sellers called caccia alla volpe or after the fox br br richard carlson went on to do led three lives on tv in the early 1950s br br vic mature was offered the part of sampson father in the remake of sampson and delilah he supposedly was asked if he would have any problems playing the part of the father since he was so well known as sampson victor replied if the money is right ll play sampson mother br br tom willett &#39;,
 &#39; the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece the first sequel jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though it still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in completely different style director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is bit different here but still he managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it again the action focuses on nami matsushima k scorpion and this time she out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back after escaping from pursuing police officers one thing leads to another and scorpion finds herself getting it together with prostitute and her retarded brother the prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother while scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison but scorpion doesn like spending time behind bars and it not long before she back to doing what she does best br br the film gets off to great start as we see scorpion hack the arm off copper intent on taking her back to jail from there however the film slows down lot and beast stable ends up being more of drama than the previous two films that not to say that there isn still plenty of action scorpion still spends lot of time in revenge mode and the film isn exactly short on general sleaze meiko kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it another understated almost wordless performance her screen presence is great however and she manages to have menacing presence despite being only small physically the plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into crescendo of revenge there are more people who have angered scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up fairly large part of the film there a few surreal sequences not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point overall would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality not as great as the original and slightly better than the second &#39;,
 &#39; neil simon the odd couple set up model for many of his later plays felix unger and oscar madison were the unsuitably paired roommates in the original the former being picky and neat the latter being slovenly and loose simon would rewrite less successfully the play in the 1990s as the new odd couple with female roommates he made it mixed couple woman with her daughter and man in the goodbye girls he also gave it an additional twist in 1973 with the sunshine boys broadway hit starring jack alberson and sam levine as al lewis and willie clark the aged semi retired vaudevillians here the apartment problem is reduced to teaming of two men who can stand each other the 1976 film starred walter matthau as willie and george burns as al br br in actuality al probably does not think totally badly of willie willie is pathological on the subject of al first al had little habits such as accidentally spitting slightly when pronouncing words beginning with the letter and slightly jabbing willie with his index finger on stage secondly al retired when his wife died willie was not ready to retire and has been forcing his nephew and agent ben richard benjamin to try to get him jobs in commercials but willie can remember lines unless they are funny and keeps flubbing them so he rarely is able to stay to the end of rehearsal for commercial br br ben is asked to get the two back together for live scene of their most famous sketch on television show about american comedy he does bring al to see willie and the sparks begin flying as neither can figure out what the other is doing and this is just in rehearsal on top of that willie is insisting on changes minor ones but they throw off al such as saying enter when al knocks on the door the initial rehearsal is failure but ben manages to get them to the taping of the show the question is if they will complete the scene in the finished program or will willie wring al neck br br the three leads matthau burns and benjamin do very well with the one liners frequently reminiscent of vaudeville patter example chest pains m getting chest pains uncle willie every thursday come here and get chest pains so come on fridays benjamin strives to prove his deep affection for his uncle although matthau rough outer shell makes it difficult he only smooths down when he discusses the glory days of vaudeville matthau has little better grasp on reality at first than burns who seems senile by his repeating himself but in actuality matthau sense of rejection by the world that once applauded him make him less willing to behave properly burns is not senile he takes things slowly but he seems far happier in accepting his retirement br br call this final voyage of discovery for our modern lewis and clark al and willie transcend their old skits as they gradually end up realizing that they have more in common in their old age than they thought even the irascible willie admits that al may be to him pain in the ass but he was funny man br br burns was not the original choice for the part of al lewis supposedly dale of the team smith and dale jack benny was benny probably would have done good job but ill health forced him out he died in 1975 burns whose last involvement in any film was in the solid gold cadillac in 1956 as the narrator turned in such fine performance that he got the oscar for best supporting actor and was to have career in movies in the next decade in such films as oh god oh god you devil and going in style he died in 1996 age 100 having proved that he was more than just brilliant straight man for his wife gracie allan &#39;,

 &#39; excellent movie in many aspects vicente aranda has succeeded in depicting the time 1830 with meticulous care the light the places the feeling are perfectly perceived from the very start of the movie and along with it in opposite to what happened to mad love juana la loca rather episodic historical movie all of this beautiful photography music clothes is wrapping very fluid screenplay that reaches its climax in the only possible way br br concerning the actors paz vega as carmen is outstanding liar seductive agressive totally sexual so beautiful carmen sbaraglia is little less convincing the audience about his instant mad love for carmen but he succeeds in conveying the proper tragic mood to the whole movie recommend it to everyone the best spanish movie of the year &#39;,

 &#39; another weak third season entry is there in truth no beauty nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as spock would say fascinating the main character is an alien who must be carried around in black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane it too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise obviously think it was mistake to ever show the alien as its actual visage in no way even approximates such daunting build up all we get is the standard star trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes usually when the ship is passing through magnetic storm or something similar in any event kollos appearance can at least be tolerated by mr spock and then only if spock is wearing special visor for the longest time thought the alien name was carlos which found humorous but digress spock is required to mind meld with kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the enterprise back to safety this is accomplished but when spock kollos go back to end the mind meld by golly spock forgets his visor uh oh he goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of kollos assistant blind woman with psychic powers this might have been really bizarre excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series last season &#39;,
 &#39; this movie vampires the turning isn even really worth the 2 out of 10 m giving it the movie is very predictable from beginning up to the very end when our hero kills the leader of the vampire slayers the use of music in this movie was even bad it kept playing as if you were to expect something significant to happen at any second though it never did the acting was rank at best and the movie was just dull the only reason give this movie 2 out of 10 is because the story had potential though it ended up unable to deliver oh and did mention the wardrobe the wardrobe for this movie was obviously cheap to non existent because our hero and his girlfriend whom he trying to save throughout the entire movie wear the same outfits through the entire movie d suggest this film only if your really bored and don have good wall with fresh paint to watch dry dave the horror cowboy &#39;,
 &#39; new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co workers to steal 42 million from the truck no bad guys so no one will get hurt right of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have conscience and make things right by saving the life of dying man br br ll admit that didn really have any interest in this film but didn have any interest in fantastic mr fox either and that film made my top ten of the year armored is even more of disappointment then thought it would be as heist film it fails to deliver the goods it boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it br br despite this the film somehow has really great cast but the film doesn even use this to it advantage everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices columbus short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give crap matt dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays mr nice guy at first then when things don go his way he quickly becomes the villain the rest of the impressive cast include lawrence fisburn jean reno skeet ulrich fred ward amaury nolasco from prison break and milo ventimiglia from heros non of them do much and when they actually do something it without much reasoning behind it br br the film is relatively short but even with it running time under 90 minutes it felt dragged out how long can you make movie about guy trapped somewhere phonebooth did decent job and it was even more restricted the leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so the entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money pretend to get hit and burn the trucks they would then walk away with the money of course something goes wrong or there would be no movie right through series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer the rest of the movie is dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in how very exciting br br the script calls for our hero to have financial problems he might lose his house which would in turn make him lose his brother you see both their parents died and it just the two of them looking out for each other so now he has reason to join the heist at first he didn want in but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things how convenient br br armored whole spin on the heist genre is that it from an armored truck from the guys who drive it after that basic premise the film falls flat on it face found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke speaking of the ending it sucks br br skip it &#39;,
 &#39; for really wonderful movie you could also try seeing the movie about saint francis of assisi good for any audience best thing liked about this movie was the mexico landscape it gets the movie up to 2 was surprised that these actors didn have terrible sunburn they were so were not desert dwellers and moses is said to have speaking impediment but certainly not here even the miracle scenes were contrived un believable and what the point if you can belief anything in tv story talk about dumbing down thought this hallmark made movie was pathetic can see why others hate hollywood don just some of these corporate profit grubbers you don have to be any kind of religious to benefit from jesus of nazareth but for this waste of celluloid you need to be bored with nothing to do dumbed down religious and for real movie experience try short cut to nirvana very highly rated film &#39;,

 &#39; if you re t rex marc bolan fan recommend you check this out it shows whimsical side of marc bolan as well as ringo starr apparently having pretty good time shooting some of the scenes that aren part of the concert but fun to watch leaving you with sense of getting to know them as just people and when the concert is shown talented musician both playful and professional that rocks and seems to impress the screaming girls watching him in concert you would never know that being rock star is job but just having great time playing some great songs with some good friends like elton john and ringo starr appearing in some of the live performances true there are few songs missing that would like to have seen on there but like any album it can have everything just bought this in 2006 but if would have know it came out in 1972 would have definitely bought it years ago sad and strange that man with so many songs about his love for cars would never learn to drive and would die in car crash &#39;,
 &#39; from the very opening scene you will notice just how hard they tried to mimic the very smart and powerful cruel intentions and how flat it landed you ll also notice what terrible choice they made by casting robin dunne as valmont then in the second scene you meet the two best things in this movie amy adams and mimi rogers as kathryn and her mother that is if you can get past the fact that kathryn wasn blonde in the first film then the movie goes on you see the cheap romantic story from miles ago and you notice sebastian has already met an anette in the past here called danielle and cecile here called cherie how original is that for prequel then it turns into low budget wild things type of film with lots and lots of oh my twists as mentioned robin dunne was very bad choice not that he is bad actor he good he just doesn have the charisma ryan did amy adams who is in my opinion one of the most talented young actresses of our time once again delivers but with all the talent in the world there is no way one could save this trash as whole this movie feels like beverly hills 90210 episode the score has been stolen from cruel intentions and jawbreaker yes they used the score from jawbreaker couldn they at least leave that one alone you ll want to pass this one if you want more cruel intentions watch stephen frears dangerous liaisons &#39;,
 &#39; the chipmunk adventure is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980 alvin and the chipmunks have always been of some interest to me since they were what really got me into rock and roll neither one of the chipmunks has any bad traits alvin really the star and has all the cool looks theodore is the lovable sensitive one then there simon my personal favorite the smart one who is often party pooper also like the chipettes lot there brittany who like alvin is one who is always trying to be so popular then there eleanor who like theodore is sweet sensitive and loves food janette is the only chipette who is not much like her counterpart she very naive and really clumsy br br in the chipmunks very first full length movie david seville is going on business trip to europe and he leaving the boys with miss miller while he gone while playing an arcade game alvin loses against brittany and then says that if he had the money he race brittany around the world for real unbeknownest to the kids man named klaus furschtien and his sister claudia who have been trying to come up with sneaky way to deliver diamonds around the world in exchange for cash overheard this conversation and said that they let them race around the world for 100 000 alvin and brittany accept it and go on the race br br this adventurous movie has lot of great songs off to see the world made for an appropriate theme song for the movie then there is getting lucky one of my favorite songs in the movie my mother is most likely the sappiest song in the movie but it always makes me cry wooly bully is the only cover song used in the movie the rest were completely original then of course there the boys and girls of rock and roll which in my opinion has to be one of the greatest musical numbers in movie history br br used to watch this movie very often until my recorded tape of it died still watch the movie though this is actually fun movie for people who are about to go on vacation to foreign country for the first time it ll give you an idea of what kind of stuff you expect out of world travel definitely one of my childhood movies and one that d recommend to 80 fans and alvin the chipmunks fans &#39;,

 &#39; this was allocated to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the world wrestling federation and the alliance an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars because the final match to duduce the superior company was tag team match the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match interfernce is necessary each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches executes special move and tags in partner the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf it was obvious with that statement that the wwf would prevail overall very innovative storyline but poor execution which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag team the remaining matches are just revolting br br edge versus test potent big boot by test but this did not display the true talents of both stars br br al snow versus christian good match but superflous to the pay per view br br taji versus william regal the worst match of the night br br immunity battle royal this was an outstandingly fun match to watch but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event only wrestler who characteristically appears on heat and is probably wcw light heavyweight reject e the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer br br hardy boyz versus dudley boyz the best match of the night jeff hardy executed swanton bomb from the summit of cage and through wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage which appeared to be extremely painful br br because stone cold was the wwf champion rob van dam was the hardcore champion and kurt angle was mole in the alliance all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of the alliance were granted work after the match outcome except for booker who recently attacked wrestler on raw and will inevitably be given work shane mcmahon will return to television somehow and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the alliance to see stone cold out of work the wwf has done much better match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better and what ever became of casket and iron man matches &#39;,
 &#39; before seeing this was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated emmanuelle series starring sylvia kristel it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be it actually has story and it is very romantic indeed what makes yellow emanuelle so good is it leading heroine the beautiful and exotic chai lee she plays her character emy wong so sweetly that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her emy wong is much respected doctor statuesque with regal quality she comes from an important old family where ancient customs are still practiced emy will remain virgin until she is married to man she has never met the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage it is simply how it is done in her world however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works emy decides to do away with custom and she gives herself to her western man but only after very long courtship as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman her pilot george is good guy and promises to marry emy so that she doesn lose her respectability and place in her rigid society neither one counts on third party one ilona staller who destroys their relationship through series of vicious games emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man that he only played game with her in order to sleep with her her place in society is gone she has been debased the film takes surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud elegant woman gives up her career as well as sweet relationship with her caring father and succumbs to life of drinking and prostitution was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town and unknowingly walks into hotel where his beautiful emy is working as prostitute classic drama imagine many viewers were bit frustrated by all this drama one would expect lots of sex and nudity here but there is not much and when there is it is totally non exploitative and very artsy and soft core if you are fan of the first emmanuelle with sylvia kristel than you most likely will appreciate this lesser known classic was especially impressed by the extra attention to details the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice her father shows george and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees he has whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees totally unexpected after catching it on late night cable tv years ago spent much time searching the internet for copy of the film when finally got it found that the video version was longer more sex no more melodrama for the dvd release there is subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease actually preferred the cable version better am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70 soundtrack while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare and quite special recommend it to thoughtful viewers who don need sex and violence to maintain their interest &#39;,
 &#39; spoilers spoilers released in 1956 and considered quite racy at the time douglas sirk over the top candy colored melodrama is still wonderful thing the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle who is insecure weak wounded very alcoholic played by robert stack in very touching vulneable performance and his sluty sister marylee played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone ms malone performance is telegraphed to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for rock hudson and jealousy for lauren bacall malone is the only actress ve ever seen in movies who enters room eyes first now don get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950 but it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as malone is she not very good actress and she not capable of subtly or shading her performace is of one note she does get to do wicked mambo and in great montage as unloving daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing staircase sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing orgasmic dance as she undresses stack who should have won an oscar malone who won the award but shouldn have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the hysteria both sexual otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film hudson bacall fade to grey brown which are the colors that they are mainly costumed in hudson who was better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of stack and the stalked love interest of malone who moans groans over rock through most of the film but hudson wants no part of her and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack no one is very happy no one is happy for very long the stack bacall marriage falls apart big time after year and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is sterile and can give bacall baby to prove that he a man sirk who was very intelligent man and had long fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950 with series of intense vividly colored women movies or melodramas although they were mainly adapted from medicore or trashy source material in sirk hands they became masterpieces of the genre sirk had wonderful sense of color design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color combinations lighting make believe shadows and lots of mirroed reflections in written the characters are always peeking out of windows listening at doors or sneaking around so in the end after much violence an accidental murder miscarriage more sirk ends the movie with final startling scene of reborn and reformed malone in man tailored suit sitting at desk foundling miniature oilwell &#39;,
 &#39; duck_of_death needs to watch this film again as his major criticism is completely baseless the film never once forgot about the time delay and it was mentioned explicitly in couple of places the crew were never shown having conversations with mission control that didn obey the time delay rules br br one thing did think was bit far fetched was the amount of risk involved would crew land on planet on which pressure suits would only last two hours doubt it would manned space ship go into star corona doubt it would humans land on moon that was being bombarded with huge amounts of radiation doubt it also the ship seemed overly sturdy would ship designed like that risk atmospheric flight to slow it down doubt it would it survive being hit by comet debris doubt it think in both cases the stresses on the structure would be too much but all in all the unlikely scenarios were compensated by some nicely done special effects good editing and production and some good acting especially by the actors portraying the ship commander and the russian cosmonaut &#39;,

 &#39; had heard interesting critics on this movie believed it was love story but wasn sure what was the plot about so when finally saw it found myself in the middle of love relationship between the ex con isabel isabel ampudia and the junkie rufo sebastiã haro so love story but not probably what was expecting br br the movie is focused on isabel as she struggles to get back into society she doesn want to return back to her neighborhood and she finds herself without home or anywhere to go so while she just experiences those first hours of freedom after being released from jail she came across rufo an old acquittance of her which while she was in had become junkie and lives on the streets not having where to go and without money or feasible source of income she decides to join rufo on his residence covered area on lonely street br br the story by itself is moving it explains how the impossible relationship between isabel and rufo gets deeper until the the almost final twist of the movie br br definitely the movie is worth watching sebastiã haro is splendid in his role of the junkie person being able of both being an innocent and tender giving person and ruthless street scum just depending whom deals him with believe his role br br on the other hand don quite believe the role of isabel ampudia although the movie tries to show the bitterness inside her through several scenes she is not capable to make me believe it she is in way too sweet and too honest for which might be expected of somebody on the same situation br br the movie tries to show love on desperate situation it is enjoyable movie but the feeling get when the movie ends is that isabel with the way of thinking and acting she has would never have arrived to that situation her role partly because of the script partly because of the acting is difficult to believe br br specially like the ending and because of it have raised my rating one or two points liked its bittersweetness and the fact of showing that sometimes survival instinct is above other more spiritual considerations as love br br summarizing an interesting movie but it lacked some punch to be total must see &#39;,
 &#39; don hand out ten star ratings easily movie really has to impress me and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels they still stand as powerful landmark in cinematic achievement the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours br br from the moment that the opening title appeared knew we were in for ride paul greengrass has done it again everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera however for me that last one was never problem think it adds to the suspense br br will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd simply because it is genius it is perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy &#39;,

 &#39; cannot believe how popular this show is consider myself an avid sci fi fan have read countless sci fi novels and have enjoyed many sci fi movies and tv shows really wouldn even consider this true sci fi every episode have sat through was like lame watered down version of star trek episode minus anything that might make it interesting or exciting br br it basically bunch of people standing around in army fatigues talking about something boring who occasionally go through the stargate and end up on planet that looks just like earth with people who look and sound just like humans it seemed extremely low budget the characters are all forgettable one dimensional cutouts and the many attempts at humor fall flat it reminds me when you see commercial with famous athlete in it trying to be funny but he is not it is just sad br br the movie was terrible as well there is so much you can do with portal through space yet every place the army people go is boring this shows no imagination actually thought the tv series alien nation from few years back based on the movie alien nation was much better that show actually had good story lines and decent characters wasn crazy about alien nation but compared to this overrated crap it was great br br also unlike the great new battlestar galactica series stargate copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely they should have at least updated the cheesy toilet flushing special effect of whenever somebody goes through the stargate &#39;,

 &#39; if like me you enjoyed the first film bruce almighty my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high in fact disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are above the age of 12 and have any film sense at all br br without giving too much away the story sees evan bruce nemesis co anchor from the first film move home with his family to the virginian suburbs to change the world with new political path what follows is rather far fetched and quite silly storyline which is obviously set out to target young children as the main target audience unlike it predecessor evan almighty is family orientated film with the ambiguous genre of comedy tagged upon it misleading position of sequel to which some would regard modern day comedy classic that can be enjoyed by slightly more mature upscale audience br br generally speaking evan almighty comprises itself of terrible cinematic values the acting omit steve carell and morgan freeman was rigid and many of the characters were seemingly thrown in to use up the unnecessarily large budget issued for the production additionally the cast includes acting legend john goodman who makes an appearance as heel and is seen just few times in the movie entirety didn quite buy the character though and thought the storyline from which he was involved in lacked depth even for family comedy every other character in the movie especially the wife and kids deserve mention for their acting so cheesy it could fill king size kiev be warned though it is the typical americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family orientated films so d advise you defend yourself with the nearest grater in sight br br it may seem the movie is worthless thus far however it does have some promising aspects the cgi was outstanding and it was clear that lot of time went into modelling the ark and producing water effects and animation of the computer generated animals towards the end the particles renders and textures used were aesthetically stellar although part of me couldn help but think these were undeserving to movie with such poor ideals and were in my opinion too good for this piece of cinema and carried the movie throughout br br overall view this film as disaster in terms of continuing what was franchise with huge potential but unfortunately it fell short to bad conclusion in the almighty series and approaching the end of the film had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to make up for the mediocre content had so far witnessed this wasn the case and was deeply disappointed and confused come the closing credits as sat discontent couldn help but think the movie wasn anywhere near as mighty as hoped for in many ways the film reminded me of watered down night at the museum as it showed similar styling and characteristics but unfortunately was leagues below even that br br give this movie 3 out of 10 as it is watchable but it definitely one to be avoided if you have to see this film be prepared for disappointment as mildly entertained is the best you could hope to obtain in watching the said production &#39;,
 &#39; this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man phillipe harel as notre heros is bit like an amalgam of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector clouseau in his stoicism and chauncey gardiner in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn have clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all br br he has stoicism and fatalism that defies any hope of ever achieving coupledom his friend jose garcia as tisserand is in the same plight yet at least makes brave effort to transcend his extended virginhood he 28 and admits he never had sex br br very good outdoor shots of paris and rouen where the two software people travel on business they try various nightclubs and places but all to no avail my theory is that they re trying the wrong places they go to more or less youth nightclubs they should try the type that has older people more their own age br br harel increasingly becomes isolated and does little de niro effort as in taxi driver urging his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who pulled nice looking girl in the nightclub br br worth watching &#39;,
 &#39; this is without doubt one of the worst movies ever emphasize ever made whatâ worse my old hero dolph is in it and heâ starring it jesus the story is actually quite good but the way itâ carried out made even my body hurt the fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter the actors except for dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you canâ help but wonder if their reason for being there is that theyâ re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time this is â 12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost canâ be cent above â 1000 &#39;,
 &#39; am glutton for movies love the old drive in fare like this movie this film made for very little money it seems does do one thing that some bigger budgeted films fail it is cheezy it is gory it has no real plot but it entertained me for an hour and half was either laughing or covering my eyes in shock there are few great effects like shot from inside guy mouth when he gets stabbed in the chin by knife and it pokes up through his tongue and slams into the roof of his mouth and one gross out with guy getting his eyeballs yanked out but there is also loads of zombies and some psycho killers patterned after texas chainsaw massacre and demon possessed scarecrow loved the dialogue that the killers spout as they torture and kill people it has great camera work and some cool editing tricks this one is more original than the first bloodbath and the undead look better but it is still patterned after those dubbed trashy zombie movies of the 70 and 80 and it still has cheeze factor that ranks mighty high don expect romero just second rate fulci would say that horror fans will like it and it is funny and cheezy and fast ride through movie land &#39;,
 &#39; eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing have ever seen in my life when saw it for the first time about 2 years ago was in stitches for weeks after it to date have seen it further 17 times and still laugh my ass off each time for those who dont know eddie murphy was brilliant stand up comedian before he was hollywood superstar there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle if you are not the sort of person who can stand swearing then wouldn advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5 10 seconds gave this 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best &#39;,
 &#39; very much looked forward to this movie its good family movie however if michael landon jr editing team did better job of editing the movie would be much better too many scenes out of context do hope there is another movie from the series they re all very good but if another one is made beg them to take better care at editing this story was all over the place and didn seem to have center which is unfortunate because the other movies of the series were great enjoy the story of willie and missy they re both great role models plus the romantic side of the viewers always enjoy good love story &#39;,

 &#39; saw the merchant of venice in london last week great acting by al pacino jeremy irons joseph finnes and lynn collins compare to other movies based on shakespeare play this production has made the play so easy to understand and follow bravo to michael radford for directing such top actors the costume and the scenery are great and since it was filmed on location in venice it gives the film and authentic flavor had read the play over thirty years ago at school and the emphasis was on the characters anti semitic behavior toward the jews and the cruelty of the christians do not know if this movie is going to be controversial but in any case am sure that it will get few oscar nominations &#39;,
 &#39; southern cross written and directed by james becket is waste of good celluloid and actor efforts formula film is not necessarily bad if it pays off on it promise which this film does not it is tiresome concoction of movie cliches that can be traced to thousand different films from the past it is full of random and empty plot twists that add nothing but aimless action such as trip by the protagonists to ghost town where the villains unexplainedly follow them this was obviously concocted as an excuse for shoot out and escape scene bordering on the preposterous with people popping in and out of doorways and running past windows while firing pistols at each other it makes one believe that somebody told becket there was ghost town in the chilean foothills and he said oh great lets do shoot out scene there br br don even waste your rental money on this it is bunch of random bits and pieces from hundred different films thrown together to call an action drama &#39;,
 &#39; what can be said about such pathetic movie br br very bad acting the main actress seems to know only one facial expression fear mixed with weakness like poor beaten dog the other actress the one who plays the evil looks like the female double of ozzy osbourne with an awful red wig the other actors are so pitiful that they don even worth being described br br there absolutely no plot the story begins with possibilities but goes nowhere we don know anything about the meaning of 11 11 nor who rayden really is excepted the simple she evil or she a child of apocalypse which is not an explanation we don know why the parents have been killed what kind of danger is growing and why sara was chosen as the film goes on we just watch pseudo scary scenes with bad music moreover the end doesn tell anything we just see two possibilities as if one of them was bonus scene or the director cut there no plot so no possible interpretation br br 11 11 is just full of clichã it is so obvious that couldn help laughing for example the deserted library or the bathroom scenes ghost silhouettes walking with blast of wind there even the fashionable little scary girl as in dark water or the ring of course the main character is bullied at school and looks like stereotyped gothic girl dark hair red lips skinny black clothes is it an obligation to make her credible don think so the psychology of sara is so few developed and so typical that it doesn make her credible nor endearing br br terrible direction as said nothing original everything has already been seen thousand times and is used here without any real purpose br br there are some funny incoherences for example don know if ghost science paranormal course or whatever is taught in american universities in europe it is really not the case teachers talking about negative energies or using unmaterial creatures sensors ridiculous also how can you watch movie shot in the sixties with super 8 camera on computer screen without spending hours of your time for digitalization in the movie they watch it immediately on the computer screen and how can you on this old film isolate tiny detail then zoom in and see perfectly identifiable face wonder if the director has ever tried to digitize an old analogical film br br eventually 11 11 just worths being watched if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your couch but it an expensive way to fall asleep &#39;,
 &#39; before start my review here is quick lesson in australian slang which may help you with viewing the movie and understanding some of the other reviews from australia and overseas br br in australian slang thongs are pair of rubber sandals not to be confused with the same american word that pertains to butt revealing underwear stubbies are brand of australian short stubby is small can sized bottle of beer and stubby holder is foam insulator for small bottle of beer br br if you love black comedies about smalltime criminals then you will love this movie unfortunatley lot of people on imdb with weak stomachs and no appreciation of dark humour have reviewed this movie which unfortunately makes this movie appear to be more mediocre than what it is lot of reviewers have also compared it to lock stock and pulp fiction while it is the same genre it is completely different and original style br br lot of reviewers have also panned this movie for using heath ledger characters dead brother to open and guide the narrative for this movie without watching the movie closely enough to realise that his brother was killed by the same villain that wishes to kill heaths character this is explained midway through the movie but not clearly enough for most to understand br br this movie is also reminiscent of lock stock and reservoir dogs in that it is the director writers debut feature and for debut feature it rates as well as these two movies as matter of fact like lock stock and reservoir dogs rate this movie as 10 10 for director writers debut unfortunately unlike tarantino and ritchie jordan fails to live up to expectations in his subsequent movies like ned kelly br br this movie is one that you should definitely add to your dvd collection and is one that holds up to several viewings quite easily &#39;,
 &#39; know know plan 9 from outer space is the worst movie or maybe manos the hands of fate but can get worked up over those sock monkey movies of course they re bad how could they be any good but if you re talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent the rex of all turkeys has to be yentl all the treacly phoniness all the self absorbed asininity that stains everything barbra streisand has done since 1964 reaches its culmination in this movie from its lonely summit of awfulness yentl looks back to star is born and forward to the mirror has two faces there is nothing else quite like it what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie would rather not speculate and what audience she was playing to cannot possibly imagine although ll bet there a nine in ten chance you aren a member of it br br nobel prize winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it it is tribute to streisand impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn commit suicide but went on to make more awful movies &#39;,
 &#39; when jim wynorski first announced he would be doing new sequel for my favorite series of all time the slumber party massacre series was ecstatic had been waiting for new installment for literally years so production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped then the announcement of title change no longer would this new sequel be titled slumber party massacre iv but cheerleader massacre instead was bit disappointed but having different title would be very small price to pay for film had waited so long to happen was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it br br maybe month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them began to become apprehensive on jim wynorski cheerleader massacre br br tonight got to see the film for the first time in full length and am still scratching my head as read in another review cheerleader massacre is definitely not new installment in the slumber party massacre series but slasher flick all on its own and bad one at that br br before get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of jim wynorski films am always thought him to be true camp genius with winner almost every time yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don contain the most top notch acting around but they re fun nonetheless they are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have good time from sorority house massacre ii to hard to die to chopping mall jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion one of the reasons why was excited that this film would be his latest project br br cheerleader massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films had seen this director writer create in the past firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something had never seen jim do before the actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable the killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunatic br br of course the film is littered with female nudity this is jim wynorski movie we re talking about folks but some of the boob shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time there is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects shower scene in jim sorority house massacre ii the girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way br br cheerleader massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least the opening scene is literally something we ve all seen in hundreds of past slasher flicks guy and girl making out on the verge of consummating their relationship when you guessed it they re hacked to pieces br br brinke stevens who ve never really considered to be tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo we re talkin possible cue cards here she recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original slumber party massacre plays why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not new spm have no idea there is also two explosions seen in this movie that am almost certain were recycled from other films br br not only does this film recycle footage from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well some of the music used in humanoids from the deep which was also recycled prior for the coroner can be heard throughout the entire film there are at least two more as well that cannot identify but am certain have been used before br br after sitting through this film horrendous acting ridiculous story non existent gore special effects and camcorder like quality am having some serious concerns toward mister wynorski career has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche only time will tell oh and let not forget his newest film new installment in the sorority house massacre films now titled final exam think m seeing pattern here &#39;,
 &#39; too bad couple of comments before me don know the facts of this case it is based on actual events highly publicized disappearance and murder case taking place in the wilmington de philadelphia pa region from 96 through 2000 have to admit was highly skeptical of how hollywood would dramatize the actual history and events and was actually quite impressed on how close they stayed to what was constantly reported on local newscasts and philadelphia inquirer news stories throughout the time period of course immediately pointed out that the actress who really like in cold case who played fahey looked nothing like her anne marie was actually prettier have to admit though that mark harmon really nailed the type of personality that was revealed as capano and the behavior that capano exhibited throughout this period details of the case were right on no deviations of dramatic effect even down to the carpet gun furniture and cooler in conclusion also wanted to add that have met tom carper many times at various functions good man despite being politician and am so glad that he pulled the strings in the federal realm necessary to solve this heinous crime guys like capano are real and it was great to see him finally put behind bars &#39;,
 &#39; tuned into this thing one night on cable channel few minutes after the credits ran so didn know who had done it at first the longer saw it the more started thinking jesus this looks like an albert pyun flick wasn quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the utah desert scenery was beautiful and scott paulin gave an hilarious performance as simon murderous cyborg but with some style and sense of humor paulin must have ad libbed the many clever one liners he shot out because albert pyun hasn written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career unfortunately paulin doesn have all that much screen time before he gone and the movie the worse for it lance henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as he done in countless other movies like this don know what the hell kris kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the utah desert looked like and get paid for it he goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in tent kathy long the nominal hero has great body is attractive has great body fights extremely well has great body and doesn have an iota of acting talent but that doesn matter in movie like this this being an albert pyun film it full of the trademarks that we ve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost reel in the middle of the picture and figured ah nobody ll ever notice br br as bad as this movie is however it a shade above most of pyun other efforts this is citizen kane compared to his brain numbing adrenaline feel the rush for example the fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying alright already go to something else and long is very athletic and as previous poster has noted has great derriã re it not good movie by any stretch of the imagination but it not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as pyun usual extravaganzas you could do worse than rent this movie not much worse granted but worse nonetheless &#39;,
 &#39; this flick was even better then waiting for guffman the great strength in these two films lie in the brilliant character acting by guest and levy little second second city troupe if one finds this movie boring or pointless god help em they just didn get it it is mockumentary something at which guest and levy have genius for at the end of the movie where guest southern down home dog lover tells us that to relax after the show he went to israel to work on caboose or when he tells us that ventriloquism is an ancient art and we see hieroglyphic br br of an ancient egyptian holding tiny ancient egyptian in it hand realized it is moments like this that make life worth living thank you mr guest and mr levy and god bless you &#39;,
 &#39; without doubt the best burt reynolds film ever even better than smokey and the bandit this was probably the first real bloody cop thriller of the 1980s and delivered the perfect blend of humor action mystery and style that is missing in today films br br this one has it all psychotic henry silva jacked up on pcp 1 000 night call girls ninja assassins and burt reynolds getting his fingers sliced off one by one with butterfly knife the film is based on the novel by william diehl who also wrote primal fear another one of my all time favorites this movie is worth watching just to see henry silva get shot six times crash through window and fall thirty stories from the top of an atlanta high rise this is probably the coolest stunt in hollywood history performed by legendary stuntman dar robinson br br robinson also played moke in the elmore leonard movie stick also starring burt reynolds stick features another great dar robinson stunt robinson falls from miami apartment building and unloads all six shots from 44 magnum on his way down very cool stuff br br sharky machine is my favorite police drama never understood why this film flopped the way it did if burt did more films like this he would ve built better reputation for himself he proves to be talented director with sharky as well as gifted actor burt is supported by brian kieth charles durning bernie casey richard libertini rachel ward and everyone favorite bad guy henry silva please remake this classic film get affleck and samuel and some other hot actors and you ve got great movie just waiting to be filmed br br give it 9 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; plot melissa is new girl in town she fifteen years old and her birthday is coming up in one week since melissa is beautiful every boy in town wants to hook up with her but the few that manage to catch her interest mysteriously die br br to be honest the real reason wanted to watch this film is because dana kimmel of friday the 13th pt 3 was in it which isn a proper reason why to rush out and see movie when started watching it realized that sweet sixteen isn a very good slasher it really dull and boring and just doesn go anywhere after over an hour only three murders have occurred and the story hasn really developed in any possible way br br the movie is nicely shot with quite nice photography and good directing but just as with many other slasher flicks from the 80s the movie suffers from being too dark at times the acting is actually pretty good though and melissa character is easy to sympathize with even though she a complete slut br br the story line isn completely rubbish but it just way too dull to keep you interested the only things that kept me interested was melissa she was stunning and dana kimmel whose really sweet and cute in this movie br br all in all pretty dull slasher flick that doesn go anywhere d definitely wouldn recommend it to slasher fans &#39;,
 &#39; this film is very funny film the violence is bad the acting is well dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in personally think this movie really does suck the story and characters could be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better but the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it this film is possibly the worst rate film ever and believe me that hard to achieve especially when you re competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies m not cof fan and so just see this as another rubbish movie really bad one if dani made this as comedy then good going him very well done over than that though rate it low for it crappiness watch it when you re in happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you re high on multiple different types of drugs &#39;,
 &#39; the first time saw this movie it didn seem to go anywhere when watched it second time though it made lot more sense give it chance watch it more than once there are lot of key elements that shape the story that could be missed the first and even second time watching it the cohen brothers brilliantly weave actual happenings of the early 20th century into this story to make believable setting and storyline the combination of clooney leading role blends well with turturro and nelson supporting acts john goodman appearance in the movie is hilarious the soundtrack is great as well this movie has become household favorite for my family 10 10 for sure &#39;,
 &#39; wasted effort on the surface it a typical disaster movie we re involved in the lives of few people who get caught up in the big event however the script is so awful and there so much explaining of the characters background within the dialogue that we feel we re being treated like morons even sesame street didn explain the origins of mr snuffleupagus or how mr hooper died we can work it out someone thought that entering enron into the script would give it currency when discussing power companies the acting is by and large bland with the exception of the older performers randy quaid brian dennehy and after the first hour couldn care less about who the storms took out br br but maybe there are the special effects to watch sadly no even on 20 year old tv set could see one tractor and trailer were computer generatedâ badly maybe there are budgetary limitations so can forgive that one footage of plane trying to land looked pretty real but kept telling myself had seen that before this site confirms it it was from an earlier film nowhere to land br br so in summary the only good bits are from another film and when you see the best action sequences compressed into 30 second network promo it makes category 6 look quite good my advice rely on your network to do some good 30 second clips watch them and save yourself two nights &#39;,
 &#39; first of all we know that bruce willis is good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you ll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far and counting the story begins in the not so far future where man is sent to the past to find the source of virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth the story seems to go towards sf but think its closer to drama because of the slow rhythm of the story about that movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you ll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good but that doesn mean that the ending wont pull your nerves cause its pretty good as far as the direction goes it is prefect movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better so if you are getting ready to see sci fi movie or some action you ll miss it there should be more movies like this &#39;,

 &#39; just like last years event wwe new years revolution 2006 was headlined by an elimination chamber match the difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value in reality only three people stood chance of walking out of the pepsi arena in albany new york with the wwe championship those men were current champion john cena kurt angle and shawn michaels there was no way vinnie mac would put the belt on any of the rookies carlito or chris masters and kane kane last held the wwe championship in june 1998 and that was only for one night it was obvious he wasn going to be the one either last years match was thrilling affair with six of the best wwe had to offer 2006 was predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far br br the only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event out strolled vince mcmahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber it was then announced that edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there with no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the elimination chamber match john cena did not stand chance and dropped the title after spear to one of the most entertaining heels in wwe this was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night br br the undercard like last year was truly atrocious triple and the big show put on snore fest that had me struggling to stay away hhh picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it any pay per view that has both jerry lawler and viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming success really does it the king pinned helms who books this stuff and big vis tasted defeat against the wasted shelton benjamin with little help from his mama br br the women of the wwe also had busy night there was the usual diva nonsense with bra and panties gauntlet match which was won by ashley and the woman championship was also on the line in match thought would have been left to brew till wrestlemania 22 mickie james challenged trish stratus in good match trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future br br the opening contest of the night pitted soon to be wwe champion edge against intercontinental champion ric flair this could have been better but it was battered and bloody flair that retained after disqualification finish edge obviously had bigger fish to fry br br so new years revolution kicked off the 2006 pay per view calendar in disastrous fashion the only good thing from that is knowing that for the wwe the only way is up they don get much worse than this &#39;,
 &#39; was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that haven yet and found this little screen gem one of those occasions when you see movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it darn well guess will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was pretty good flick when saw it it has been awhile however remember it used to come on hbo late at night and watched it two or three times and haven seen it really since and would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it the story follows cyborg and guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them think that is basically all there is to it throw in few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well there is also love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not top notch film but for b movie it is really good don know if it was theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those &#39;,

 &#39; raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick foran thanks to his affection for his friend wife angela lansbury this was full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting br br there isn all that much else here that interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there an interesting performance by lamont johnson as painter who also in love with the femme fatale but the burr character is pretty straightforward it frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films ve seen him in there no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with very large tape recorder which she doesn notice when she comes into the room guess br br few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv &#39;,
 &#39; saw this with few expectations and absolutely loved it bend it like beckham is fairly typical coming of age movie about fairly atypical girl this is parminder nagra er breakout role playing jess teenager in england who is caught between her traditional indian family and her love of football that soccer to us north americans and even though she actually much older than her character she plays the role pitch perfect br br this is movie about friendship specifically jess friendship with jules keira knightley her teammate who is also going through family issues especially with her mom who wears purple nail polish and little bows on her shoes and who wants jules to be more feminine wear lacy underwear and flirt with boys and is terrified that playing sports means her daughter is lesbian jules and jess both love playing the game and have issues trying to convince their families to let them go after their dreams they also unfortunately both love the same man joe their coach played by jonathan rhys meyers the love triangle causes some strain in their friendship br br in some spots bend it like beckham falls into clichã in others scenes drag on far too long and this movie probably could have benefited from overall tighter editing br br but this was refreshingly fun film about growing up culture clash and the love of football it about female empowerment chasing your dreams and supporting your friends funny charming and fun bend it like beckham is the little film that could and did br br excellent 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; gary busey is superb in this musical biography great singing and excellent soundtrack the buddy holly story is much better movie than la bamba from reading other comments there may be some historical inaccuracies regardless it is fun toe tapping film and good introduction to buddy holly music &#39;,
 &#39; this film is really bad it maybe harsh but it is it really is poor script every vampire clichã in the book is used and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character e ole dracula there have been some truly brilliant dracula vampire movies in the past but this doesn even make it into the dire slot br br take selection of people who seem to have dropped out of teen slasher move add dribble of dracula lore and mix in heady tonic of religious surreal day dreaming and you get confusing mess of film dracula 2000 br br really cannot find any good things to say about this movie as if it wasn bad enough that it was made in the first place they seem to have made johnny lee miller effect an english accent whats the problem with that hear you cry well he is english but he sounds like an american trying to do an english accent br br all in all you may as well say your money if you were thinking of buying it or rent it out watch it and discover for yourself why it about as scary as the tellytubbies br br s although la la is pretty frightening &#39;,
 &#39; one of the worst movies ever made if you can get through this movies without falling asleep then you are doing pretty good considering no matter how hard you turn up the volume you cant hear what the actors are saying and if you can acually see whats going on from the terrible film mean hell if you cant find anything that works better use home movie camara at least you can acually tell whats going on br br it is beyond my imagination how people get movie like this to slip through the cracks and escape on video and further more how do people making this not know how terrible it is good god br br after what have just told you if you are waiting for me to give you summary of this piece of trash movie there is nothing to tell group of campers on motorcycles get lost in the woods and bunch of people terrorize them or somthing to that whats more so an action movie than horror this movie is of no interest if someone acually likes this litterally feel for you br br absolute trash not even one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent plan 9 from outerspace and have ball &#39;,
 &#39; loved this movie it was all could do not to break down into tears while watching it but it is really very uplifting was struck by the performance of ray liotta but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray twin brother who is mentally slow due to tragic and terrible childhood event but tom character though heartbreaking knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life this is great movie don miss it &#39;,
 &#39; this was the worst movie have ever seen billy zane in understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers who did pretty good for newbies but over all the movie was not believable br br with all of the gunfire you would think the police would have intervened even the coin being bug on sean was stupid the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug was not realistic br br looks like this movie was slapped together fast poor job get better writer br br the count down to the end was not in sync with anything it took longer to fight and what coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean he be out of bullets once can believe but not twice br br actually billy character was goofy it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end it was like comedy bad bad bad &#39;,
 &#39; stranded in space 1972 mst3k version very not good tv movie pilot for never to be made series in which an astronaut finds himself trapped on earth evil twin having planet of identical size and mass orbiting in the same plane as the earth but on the opposite side of the sun is well worn sf chestnut the idea is over 2 000 years old having been invented by the ancient greeks in this version the counter world is run as an orwellian perfect society where for totally inexplicable reasons everyone speaks english and drives late model american cars after escaping from his prisonlike hospital the disruptive earthian is chased around not southern california by tv and bad movie stalwart cameron mitchell who like his minions wears double breasted suits and black polo neck jumpers stylishly evil combination which fully intend to adopt if ever become totalitarian overlord our hero escapes several times before ending up gazing at the alien world three moons and wondering aloud if he will ever get home thus setting up one of those man alone in hostile world making new friend each week but moving on at the end of every episode shows so beloved of the industry in the 70s and 80s the fugitive the incredible hulk the littlest hobo etc the curiously weirdest bit though was the title sequence somewhere between stranded in space first airing under the title the stranger in 1972 and the mst3k version in 1991 it somehow acquired some footage from the 1983 movie prisoners of the lost universe so in 1991 the opening credits for stranded in space run under few shots of three people falling into matter transmitter and vanishing it a sequence that has nothing to do even thematically with anything that is going to follow br br just to add to the nerdy movie confusion one of the actors in this nailed on footage kay lenz later appeared in 1994 movie called trapped in space knowing this fact could never save your life but it might score you very big points and admiring looks from fellow trash movie enthusiasts if you could ever work out way of manoeuvring the conversation round to the point where you could casually slip it in without looking like total idiot &#39;,
 &#39; love playing football and thought this movie was great because it contained lot of football in it this was good hollywood bollywood film and am glad it won 17 awards parminder nagra and kiera knightley were good and so was archie punjabi jonathon rheyes meyers was great at playing the coach jazz parminder nagra loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married when jazz starts playing for football team secretly she meets juliet kiera knightlety and joe jonathon rhyes meyers who is her coach when her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters pinky archie punjabi wedding at the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play &#39;,

 &#39; waste of 1h45 this nasty little film is one to avoid its like cheap badly plotted cross between saw and few other recent films about kidnap why the writer wrote this is obvious he has no soul and did it to try and me some money the twists were obvious when those in peril could escape they did the obvious and didn etc only good thing about it is ve discovered 1 new actress worth watching peyton list don watch shuttle though there are too many better nicer films to watch rather than this that will make you miserable and think less of the world spend your time more wisely watch good films do some exercise cook nice meal anything but waste your time on rubbish like this &#39;,
 &#39; simply can get over how brilliant the pairing of walter matthau and jack lemmon is it like the movie doesn even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two br br lemmon had already been in several well known films like mr roberts and the apartment and matthau was fresh off his oscar win for the fortune cookie another billy wilder film also with lemmon that particular movie wasn as great as this one because the story couldn sustain such long running time think it was almost 2 hours however this goes by at brisk hour and half even though the introduction of the events leading up to lemmon ending up at matthau apartment is tad long so was this sentence that a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have marvelous time br br have already written comment about how the follow up to this film sucked and won go deeper into that the reason why this is such joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of american movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion there are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn even get well never out of the most prudish person out there it is kind of fun to see movie from long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn work because you had matthau and lemmon say quite few words and that just doesn fit them br br of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in marvelous film like this think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is john fiedler edelman died recently so there you have it simply one of the best comedies and films ever br br add have just learned recently that john fiedler has died so to all the fans of him am deeply sorry didn mean any disrespect and will try to be more careful of what am blah blah blahing next time &#39;,
 &#39; some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed the story combines some of the details of the famous leopold and loeb case along with bit of aimee semple mcpherson br br the story begins with two mothers shelley winters and debbie reynolds being hounded as they leave courtroom the crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of heinous thrill crime one person in the crowd apparently slashes winters hand as they make their way to waiting car br br soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so reynolds suggests they both move to the west coast together and open dance school the dance school is success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next shirley temple one of the parents of these spoiled kids is multimillionaire who is quite smitten with reynolds and they begin dating life appears very good but when the threatening phone calls begin again winters responds by flipping out behaving like she nearing psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion listening on the radio to sister alma almost constantly again and again you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things won say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film br br in many ways this film is lot like the bette davis and joan crawford horror films of the 1960s like whatever happened to baby jane straight jacket and the nanny while none of these are exactly intellectual fare on kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun the writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting winters is great as fragile and demented lady and reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year olds ve ever seen plus she can really really dance br br my only concern about all this is that some might find winters hyper religiosity in the film bit tacky like cheap attack on christianity at first felt that way but when you meet sister alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so took winters religious zeal as just sign of craziness which assume is all that was intended br br by the way this film is packaged along with whoever slew auntie roo another shelley winters horror film from 1971 both are great fun and quite over the top &#39;,
 &#39; this is pleasant film even if the premise is silly it was sort of guilty pleasure to watch meg ryan seems to be able to pull off roles in this kind of film another example is joe vs the volcano that what makes her star in part walter matthau of course had that ability too and he really puts himself into the role making an amusing good hearted einstein suppose you could say they re both good at portraying loveable characters though loveable in different ways loveable young women vs loveable curmudgeon &#39;,
 &#39; quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom br br group of top quality actors in the main well cast with couple of notable exceptions who give pretty good performances penelope keith is perfect as aunt louise and equally good is joanna lumley as diana all do well with the scripts they were given br br so much for the good the average would include the sets nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book although bizarrely the house they use for the dower house looks remarkably like it it is clear then that the dower house is far too big in the later parts the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the uk presumably to save money although with little imagination have no doubt they could have recreated ceylon br br now to the bad the screenplay this is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it edward does not die in the battle of britain but survives blinded he makes brief appearance then commits suicide why loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with gus to sensible farmer wife who can give up the love her life with barely tear less emotional than brief encounter gus man besotted and passionately in love is prepared to give up his love without complaint walter mudge in the book turns from shallow unfaithful husband to devoted family man jess is made into psychologically disturbed young woman who won speak aunt biddy still has drink problem but now without any justification the dower house is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than very short scene with jess who has fear of armed soldiers whilst miss mortimer breasts are utterly delightful could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward the delightfully named nettlebed becomes the mundane dobson the word limit prevents me from continuing the list br br there is sequel which lost all interest in watching after this nonsense and wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story it is difficult to image that rosamunde pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased &#39;,
 &#39; got stuck in traffic live in sicily on the way to the theater at military base to see superman returns was 15 minutes late and the only other movie playing was see no evil there was no poster up for it and just short description of the movie on the schedule but my girlfriend and decided to check it out as soon as saw it was produced by wwe just knew it was gonna be awful the few people in the theater were laughing most of the time and it was the first movie that honestly considered walking out on and ve seen the ringer okay would have walked out of that one but was too busy sleeping the death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good but other than that it was just stupid &#39;,
 &#39; forest of the damned starts out as five young friends brother sister emilio richard cambridge ally sophie holland along with judd daniel maclagan molly nicole petty andrew david hood set off on week long holiday in the middle of nowhere their words not mine anyway before they know it they re deep in forest emilio clumsily runs over woman frances da costa along with badly injured person to add to their problems the van they re travelling in won start they can get any signals on their mobile phones they need to find help quickly so molly judd wander off in the hope of finding house as time goes by darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone that there is something nasty lurking in the woods br br this english production was written directed by johannes roberts having looked over several other comments reviews both here on the imdb across the internet forest of the damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it other not personally it didn do much for at all the script is credited on screen to roberts but here on the imdb it lists joseph london with additional screenplay material whatever that means the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like the texas chainsaw massacre 1974 with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction then there stephen played by the ever fantastic tom savini who is never given any sort of justification for what he does is he there to get victims for the angels if so why did he kill andrew by bashing his head in the story is very loose it never felt like proper film the character are poor the dialogue not much better the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that going on having said that it moves along at reasonable pace there are couple of decent scenes here br br director johannes doesn do anything special it not particularly stylish or flash film to look at there a few decent horror scenes the tom savini character is great whenever he on screen although why didn he hear judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with molly it a shame when he gets killed off there are couple of decent gore scenes here someone has their head bashed in there a decapitation someone gets shotgun blasted someone throat is bitten out someones lips are bitten off someone is ripped in half there is also fair amount of full frontal female nudity not that it helps much br br technically forest of the damned is ok it reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye catching this was shot in england wales it quite odd to see an english setting for very american themed backwards horror the acting is generally pretty poor save for savini who deserves to be in better than this horror author shaun hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end proves he should stick to writing rather than acting br br forest of the damned was pretty poor horror film it seems to have fans out there so maybe m missing something but it not film have much fondness for apart from one or two decent moments there not much here to recommend &#39;,
 &#39; don know much about tobe hooper or why he gets his name in the title but maybe he shouldn have bothered as another commenter mentioned there isn really enough horror or erotica to bring in fans of either genre the plot is incoherent the sade sequences are gratuitous and most of the acting is so so englund was doing his best with weak material and zoe trilling has really great bottom but neither is enough to carry this film this one a tape over grade &#39;,
 &#39; watching john cassavetes film opening night was reminded of something that quentin tarantino said once in an interview about personal experience in being creator of art or acting he referred to an example of say if he ran over dog while on his way to act in play that it wouldn be the end of his life but that it would affect him and that without doubt he would have to bring that experience with him on stage even if it was light comedy otherwise as he said what am doing couldn help but think of his words when watching gena rowland character myrtle gordon who for almost whole week or so goes through very similar scenario there is more to this in cassavetes film of course since it about how the theater works around star actress what emotion and human nature mean when looking at playing character and how one lives when all one has like myrtle gordon is the theater br br near the beginning of the film after exiting performance myrtle is signing autographs and one such fan named nancy comes up to her favorite star and pours her heart out to myrtle it a touching little moment but it doesn last as she has to get in the car pouring rain and all she then watches in horror as the girl who stood right next to the car as it drove off gets hit by another car in an auto accident she not sure really what happened but then finds out the next day that in fact the girl did die from the hit from then on she sort of stunned by this even after she thinks it out of her system at first this shows in small ways like when she rehearses scene with her fellow actor played by cassavetes and can seem to stand being hit she blames it on the lack of depth in the character the writer what do you think the play lacks hope says myrtle but then nancy starts to show up to her an apparition that to myrtle is all to real until she suddenly gone br br cassavetes as in the past films is after search for what it means to have emotion to really feel about something and feel it or the lack thereof and how it affects others around the person this isn exactly new ground for rowlands who previously played woman on the edge of herself in woman under the influence in that case because of alcohol nor would it be alien territory for costar ben gazzara who just came off starring in killing of chinese bookie but the actors express everything essential to their characters in every scene cassavetes doesn tell them how to get from to in scene and he doesn need to there a mood in cassavetes film that trumps the sometimes grungy camera work you know myrtle for example should be content somehow even if it isn with the plot but she haunted and is unsatisfied with her character lack of depth and the tone of the play aging who goes to see that she asks the playwright and it starts to affect those around her too br br the question soon becomes though not what is the usual conventional dramatist would make the conflict will she be able to go on stage will the show go on this isn important for cassavetes even if it there as is the question will she be alright perhaps going through such grueling play as the second woman could help her work out her personal demons and her losing her grip on reality seeing sara and attacking her in front of total strangers who wonder what the hell is going on or will the play lack of hope strain everything else wrong with her the depths rowlands makes with her character are intense and harrowing and that it expected doesn mean it any duller than woman under the influence if anything it just as good as that film at being honest about person in this profession and consequently the other performances are just as true from gazarra to nancy played by subtle laura johnson cassavetes answers to his own posed questions aren easy br br one of the real thrills of opening night along with seeing great actors performing an amazing script is to see cassavetes take on the theater the way he does we see the play performed and it apparently real play and we only know slightly what it about when we see the actors on the stage performing it we wax and wane between being involved in what melodrama is going on relationship scuffling and affairs and the occasional slap and domestic violence and the improvisation of the actors wondered watching how much really was improvised how much cassavetes allowed for the other actors to do in the scenes where myrtle starts to go loopy or in the climax is completely smashed he on the stage too so it must have been something for them to work it out beforehand and let what would happen happen br br it funny startling chilling and edge of your seat stuff some of the best theater on film scenes ever put in movie and we see the lines between actor on stage actor on film actor with actor blur together wonderfully opening night is potent drama that is full of frank talk about death and madness reality and fiction where the love is between people and really finally what does acting mean &#39;,
 &#39; liked the understated character that laura linney played in love actually and she is very good in man of the year br br but wow robin williams doesn give that much of performance with couple of minor exceptions this was weak laura linney may not have been miscast but either the editing raped her character or this was just sad performance by director barry levinson br br and think it was barry levinson that got old so many weak performances such uneven results have to be the fault of management br br christopher walken and jeff goldblum are great in supporting roles goldblum plays sinister side with relish and walken combination of entertainer manager and commentator for the film is wonderful br br but the story is clichã the presentation looks like it could have should have been very good picture and too many actions are half hearted the pacing story and direction all come up weak compared to say head office spoof of secret of my success &#39;,
 &#39; this is the kind of film one watches in gape jawed horrified silence and yet continues to watch mesmerized as if watching train wreck in slow motion and yet in the back of your mind thoughts are churning who on earth green lighted this garbage br br some of the preceding user comments say things like good way to introduce children to laurel and hardy an insult to children everywhere that children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars characterizations of laurel and hardy to which would respond so what one would think that the rash of movie bombs based on beloved series rocky and bullwinkle avengers flipper mod squad ad nauseam would have taught hollywood that there are some things that simply can be recreated the films of laurel and hardy are readily available on video why bother with this br br as for murray abraham fine actor of stage and screen well all can say is he must have been in trouble with the irs br br run don walk away from the television if this trash comes on &#39;,
 &#39; sorry couldn disagree more with the last comments frankly thought this was worse than carry on columbus enough said last film for the usually brilliant charles hartrey who looked out of place as the humour had move on to the highly witty level of on the buses films of which were being made at the same time were frankly funnier barbara windsor was embarrassing character like one of your mums flirty friends who still thinks she eighteen on holiday with some non entity of scotsman rab nesbit he ain the series miraculously trundled on with duffers like carry on behind and carry on england carry on dick wasn bad but really with this film the end of the series was nigh pity because up to this film cant think of bad film before this &#39;,
 &#39; next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub genre while slasher films had black christmas and halloween to get the whole thing going zombie flicks had george romero dead films and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series other directors wanted to cash in lot of italian directors were especially interested such as lucio fulci who brought us zombie year after romero dawn of the dead known as zombi in italy and some other countries and it was there that fulci film was known as zombi 2 apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero film but is good film in it own right it was big success in europe and 9 years later sequel was born br br pros lots of beautiful lush scenery awesome score the acting isn exactly good but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience after kind of slow start the pace moves along like that of an action flick plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers good job on the make up effects lots of blood and some decent gore br br cons virtually plot less nothing you haven already seen before blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of return of the living dead films cardboard characters hasn aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music not that m saying all rock music of that period is bad clothing and overall feel of the movie br br final thoughts first of all this is not true sequel to fulci cult classic in fact don know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off for those that don know fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei mattei films are pretty laughable but like this film many are good campy fun and that all this film really is just something to watch for fun br br my rating 3 5 5 so bad it good rating 2 5 serious rating &#39;,
 &#39; first saw this film over 25 years ago on british tv and have only just caught up with it again last week on dvd copy bought off ebay had remembered the musical sequences the colour and the gorgeous fashion plate poses and clothes but the plot is weaker than the earlier anna neagle michael wilding film spring in park lane and maytime doesn stand up so well to the passage of the years but michael wilding is joy in the film charming funny debonair appears to be having great fun and on top of his form worth watching for him alone anna neagle appears little matronly beside him and little too old for the part she plays but by the end of the 1940 their film partnership was well established with the cinema going public spring in park lane had been top hit for 1947 and big money maker in his autobiography wilding wrote at length of his great regard for herbert wilcox the director and instigator of this london series of films &#39;,
 &#39; saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality of the product did rent this one back in the eighties and remember it to be good but not great movie ve always liked michael keaton style and delivery he was perfect fit for the movie br br am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie grant you yes it no oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value it more of subtle comedy rather than all out comedy farce also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences beg to differ grant you again that there are lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is hollywood film not documentary from what ve read about differences between automakers on both sides of the pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time br br some of the basic differences were that japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as whole teamwork was emphasized they perhaps made the company above all else where american workers had more of management verses labor type of relationship the individual was more important than the company ll probably get some hate email over that comment m sure br br another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix in many japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered rather as one character in the movie put it it was the dealers meaning car dealer problem br br many of these things are probably dated but m sure some are still around as many us car makers are still struggling to keep up with the japanese if one is more interested in the subject of american european and japanese automakers can recommend book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period the book is called the machine that changed the world by james womack daniel jones and daniel roos it about study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers parts are bit dry but think you ll find that it backs up much the movie also &#39;,
 &#39; this is without doubt one of my favorite columbo episodes ever the acting is very well done the music is very catchy the script is ingenious and the direction is fabulous br br peter falk who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes acts particularly well in this episode br br also great performances from stephen caffrey gary hershberger alan fudge and robert culp br br the ending is absolutely brilliant and love the way columbo describes it br br this is columbo movie that won go amiss &#39;,
 &#39; olivier assayas film stars asia argento as woman who had relationship with michael madsen madsen is business man who in financial trouble in desperation he is going to sell his share of business to company called golden eagle company from the far east as madsen begins his moves away from his company asia argento returns to his life the pair had torrid love affair that included her doing business favors for madsen with said golden eagle once argento enters the film the film follows her as we see the tangled web she woven and how the complications spin dangerously and violently out of control br br m not fan actually was quite bored as the film seems to go from pillar to post for much of the first hour during which kept wondering what the point was other than to provide meaty role for argento argento daughter of director dario argento and director in her own right is unique actress at times stunningly good she is more often then not going to give you quirky off beat portrayal of damaged human being sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn i don think it completely works here mostly because the script is too complicated to support it didn care what was going on so her wounded girl just rubbed me the wrong way she seemed more nut job than anything else m not blaming the actors but writer director assayas who has once again constructed complicated tale with the sort of parts actors love to tackle but which leave audiences scratching their heads because they they don really work br br if you must try it on cable &#39;,
 &#39; leland follows the story of leland fitzgerald ryan gosling disaffected teenager who has apparently murdered severely retarded peer the brother of girl he was dating the issue is not whether he did it or not â leland admits to it straight away â but rather why interestingly rather than crime drama leland becomes character story examining why people do what they do â not necessarily the easiest ground to till br br and leland features the required indie group of screwed up people aside from the title character there also pearl don cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile correctional facility and who sees straight off that leland is different we meet leland distant and egotistical father kevin spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally stirred in any way by what his son did but the real flavorings come out when we immerse ourselves in the pollards the family of the retarded child first there leland girlfriend becky jena malone drug addict who can keep herself clean her sister julie michelle williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and allen harris chris klein young man who lives with the pollards and is julie boyfriend lastly there ryan michael welch whom all the others call goofball who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings br br leland focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly â occasionally too slowly â burrows into everyone lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do while leland discusses it openly in journal pearl allows him to keep examining notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or another perhaps the most basic choice any human can make and the movie takes good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of them br br in the beginning of the film you re simply struck by the depth of the cast spacey cheadle gosling michelle williams even chris klein â these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for heady brew for space in the middle the film seems to stall sputtering along as it unfolds it looks for while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its stride and come together leland becomes quietly powerful piece of film making leland explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment you ve made in the film pays off br br saying ryan gosling is excellent is like saying sunny day is nice at this point in his career it redundant â this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into thought provoking protagonist gosling employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he elevates cheadle game as well cheadle himself is in top notch form imbuing pearl with fully rounded humanity â for good and bad spacey is kind of one note but that the character and he handles it excellently was surprised by chris klein with this level of acting thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far terrific work all around br br leland is bit of downer and again it draggy in spots but it finishes strongly and leaves lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway there also subtle commentary on racism in the film in leland first day in juvenile hall class he the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled wouldn go so far as to call this required viewing â some might find it too slow or too odd â but thought it was one of the better films ve seen in while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there d recommend it â with the above caveats â if for no other reason than to watch gosling further perfect his craft &#39;,
 &#39; then the second half of this movie is hard to follow got the first part with the spanish inquistion but the film skipped many years forward with the french ruling spain the movie does little to fill you in on what happened and don remember much about it so the movie gets confusing then the movie begins when ines daughter of rich merchant is accused of judiasm by the church specifically father lorenzo she is put to the question and forced to confess even her family wealth can not buy her out of prison her father forces lorenzo to sign confession saying he is the offspring of chimp in hopes of getting ines released all it does is give reason for the church to condemn lorenzo who runs off to france br br then the movie skips many years and the french revolution is in full force ines is released from prison it was very good make up work to make natalie portman look that tore up she finds her family dead and seeks goya for her help she tells him she had child in prison goya sets up meeting between her and lorenzo whom is now with the french and in power he is the father goya sees the daughter and tells lorenzo whom decides it best to send her off to america so no one will find out but before his plans get carried out the british join the spainish and spain reclaims power and he is now the persecuted that part is not well told in the film it like the film shows this to happen in day br br final verdict the movie is good until it skips many years in time after the inquistion then the movie expects you to understand what is going on it just got too confusing to me then &#39;,

 &#39; m not great at writing reviews so ll just spout my opinions br br loved this series at first the adventure the action the comedy the drama thought it was all brilliant anderson tapping shanks judge davis loved them all davis it seemed was the fifth most important person in the cast not big deal but when his character general hammond left at the end of the seventh season and anderson character colonel neill moved from the field to the office the quality of the series suddenly fell off cliff don know whether it because hammond was more important that realized or what but for some reason after the seventh season the series turned to br br the first seven seasons though were awesome the movie stargate seemed mediocre the first time saw it but it turned out to be even if this wasn the original intention brilliant setup to the series recommend that you watch the movie first then watch the first season of the tv series then watch the movie again you ll have whole new appreciation of it the second time around believe me and then watch the rest of the tv series br br the last three seasons of the series aren nearly as good as the first seven but that doesn mean they aren good it just means they re letdown if you ve gotten spoiled by the first seven seasons br br after you have finished this series be sure to watch the spin off series stargate atlantis it is worthy successor to this brilliant series br br edit on 7 18 08 just found out that don davis died few weeks ago it is great loss &#39;,
 &#39; ok anyone who could honestly say that this movie was great or even good is either delusional or knows the director writer and producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film watched the movie because friend of mine worked on it and it was horrible m an actress and have worked in the industry for while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears the reason m being so harsh is because this film was clearly different take on of mice and men and they should sue because it is such horrible rip off of the story in an industry where hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt for someone to take classic book and film of mice and men and destroy it with new spin bugs me so much the actors the accents the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal mean if your going to take new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified did not like this movie at all &#39;,
 &#39; man this movie sucked big time didn even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on don know if its just me or does this movie remind you of porn movie and don mean all the naked ladys it something about the light or something this could maybee become classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it an original movie white nice plot twist my final words are don see it it not worth the time if you wanna see it because the nakedness there lots of better ones to see &#39;,
 &#39; loved long way round and wasn even aware of race to dakar until saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket bought it and after slightly hmm will this be as good first episode decided that it was charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew great to see him with ewan again there was fair bit of swearing in it but that didn bother me as for their being no mention of it on the package thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have they should have given it 15 just for the language alone br br highly recommended series want more &#39;,
 &#39; on the heels of the well received and beloved coming of age film classic concerning the lives of teenagers as they headed into adulthood george lucas american graffiti we have cooley high an adaptation of sorts by one eric monte co creator of the popular 1970 cbs sitcom good times br br cooley high was and is viewed as black version of american graffiti instead of central california as in american graffiti we have the black slum of chicago cabrini green as the backdrop for the story here instead of america in 1962 cooley high is situated in 1964 the movie stars welcome back kotter lawrence hilton jacobs and glynn turman as the movie main protagonists and its main characters it has garrett morris playing the principal who tries to keep jacobs and turman characters named coceise and preach out of trouble great deal of the time br br you know would like to say that cooley high is worthy comparison piece to american graffiti or that it is great film on its own but can the problem lies with the fact that the producers of the film couldn or wouldn hide the sad underside of black life in america having the film in the cabrini green part of chicago doesn help things br br neither does the crass gross attempts at humor here when coceise is looking for letter of intent from college he finds his little brother has thrown down toilet when the gang visits the chicago zoo one of the gang named pooter has manure thrown on him by an ape when the turman character preach is being chased by two hoodlums in the school hangout dirty and depressing place to eat food in much less meet people at he opens the door of the girls bathroom while girl is relieving herself as he escapes through the window of the same bathroom the high school the homes of the characters the bathrooms just about everywhere in the film displays the unfortunate look of urban decay and poverty br br if that wasn enough there was the rough display of humor in the film the use of violence and profanity in the film cooley high may be an coming of age film but it is hard and rough coming of age film with little or none of the wit and liking of the use of nostalgia that made people like and appreciate american graffiti so much br br motown records had hand in making the film the company music was part of the film soundtrack but even here you get sense of same old same old as one has heard these songs before million times over not that they weren great songs within themselves but black music of that time period was more than just motown especially in chicago the song nearing the end of the movie by the spinners c cameron was not all that impressive there have been better motown ballads that have been done by better motown artists than cameron without question br br the last part of the film showing where the characters went to pay homage to the film cooley high aimed to be american graffiti it shows that preach an intelligent but underachieving student went to hollywood and became successful television writer eric monte may have patterned himself as turman character the last shot of film show preach running away from coceise funeral held on dark rainy afternoon and all the bleakness that cooley high came to represent eric monte through preach and that final scene had one little lesson for all of us when watching cooley high and for the love of the past don look back &#39;,
 &#39; wow the only people reviewing this positively are the carpenter apologists know lot of those the guys that ll watch john carpenter squat on celluloid and pinch out movie and proclaim it masterwork of horror this movie is utter crap it looks and sounds like porno good lord the soundtrack is awful and has sub par porn acting which is shocking because normally ron perlman is really very good actor honestly have no idea what carpenter was thinking when making this most likely beans beans beans until somebody fed him and rolled him up into blanket for the day they say nothing about the abortion debate whatsoever when they could have had very interesting central theme how do religious zealot anti abortionists feel when it the devil baby but instead they chose to have ron perlman and his terribly acted kids kill bunch of people and have the horribly cast doctors try to calm the hysterically bad pregnant girl not single person from this episode or what have you should come away unscathed it just awful like plan 9 from outerspace awful like good god please would somebody turn it off before soil myself awful try watching this and the thing in the same day and your mind will implode &#39;,
 &#39; but doubt many were running to see this movie or some came running out of the cinema okay that a bit harsh br br the film starts in an unintentionally comical way frankie boy comes back to his hometown after many years this already smells of clichã and the whole town is shaken by his arrival he is talked about everyone wants to talk to him and every woman he meets flirts with him like there no tomorrow even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with frankie boy little longer even his pretty niece wants piece of him sounds like one of those laughable mike hammer episodes where every single female wants stacey keach and like stacey keach frankie boy is anything but good looking woman wet dream in real life someone like sinatra without the fame wouldn get within 100 of someone as beautiful as maclaine but in this hollywood movie it the other way around maclaine is absolutely nuts about frankie boy but he couldn care less sinatra plays his cool shtick much too often in his movies and it is rarely credible dean martin is kind of miscast he isn miscast as card player but rather because of the accent which simply doesn suit him maclaine is charming as ever but she plays caricature and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film the main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen it all before movies and cheap novels frankie is the cool cat who comes back to town to get all the women and he couldn care less about his writing which predictably eventually garners recognition martin is sleazy but friendly card player maclaine is the dumb but very likable bimbo frankie blond love interest is snotty literary expert frankie brother is the successful guy who married into his wife business and has lousy marriage and so on clichã br br the story contains couple of coincidences which are little too far fetched for my taste frankie just happens to bump into his niece in locale his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the first time and then there is the awful stupid ending br br in it drunk guy bent on killing frankie boy somehow manages to find him in carnival of all places the place is utterly crowded with the typical noise and chaos plus it happening in the evening and yet the guy somehow finds frankie in spite of being drunk as doorknob and shoots at him but guess who he kills maclaine she jumps in front of the bullet to save frankie clichã which comic book writers might cringe at this utterly pathetic over dramatic and annoying ending certainly cannot please any even semi intelligent viewer and this happens on the same day that maclaine and sinatra got married the writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life how else is the writing of this movie to be explained there is even card game in which brawl ensues with frankie martin vs some clichã caricatures out of the writer vivid imagination it was like damn western suddenly another dumb thing is the way sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored maclaine as the movie progresses we find out that sinatra finds maclaine to be too dumb for him just as the blond bimbo finds sinatra to be too low class for her there is certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding maclaine maclaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blond bimbo is treated as princess and an intellectual the ironic truth is that the latter character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual her behaviour comments and opinions are mostly clichã silly confused pretentious and primitive at least maclaine character knows that she maclaine is dumb there is another irony that didn fail to notice sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story much like the writer of this movie and that why he came up with the corny crappy finale br br the film basically has solid cast and the photography is nice but the script though sometimes okay relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality based characters and events br br if you re interested in reading my biographies of shirley maclaine and other hollywood intellectuals contact me by mail &#39;,
 &#39; heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role compared to sharon stone madonna is too coarse and bauerisch she not even close br br evil incarnate sharon stone is bit long in the tooth the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding however she artfully treats us to frightening personification of evil beyond redemption in the obligatory sex scene she projects pure crystalline lust especially her hooded luminous eyes and face flat with pleasure thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest rather she seems to have slight golden glow yes yeats br br the locations gave us view of london that is welcome departure from the usual londonscapes the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed wouldn have had chance br br the original basic instinct attempts at censorship must briefly comment on the original 1992 film set in san francisco beautiful city worthy of this film it is outstanding from the music to the locations to the sets and so on paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew br br that the main baddie was woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups attempts at censorship were vehemently denied swell these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script insisting on re writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas example sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy br br on locations in san francisco the gentle tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise flashing lights and other tactics the executive producers mario kassar and andrew vajna vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics br br blowback thanks to the fulminating activists the film got huge national press coverage millions of dollars worth of free advertising their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched it also received widespread critical acclaim it was in the words of the reptilian hackett in network big titted hit sorry gentle reader just couldn resist that one yes it a gibe br br in conclusion believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2 with their brilliant musical scores aesthetics and acting are works of art br br that deserve protection under our constitution &#39;,
 &#39; having watched all of the star trek tv series episodes many times each since the 1960s most being quite good to superb and only very few being mediocre my opinion is that this one is the worst of all br br in fact think it so poorly executed as to be an embarrassment to the series it not that the story is so bad although it not particularly outstanding in any way but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters meaning those other than the regulars in this case barbara anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of mass killer and who is on mission of sort she practically calls in the role from phone and shows no real emotive abilities here although usually she never used as more than pretty face in most of her film tv roles usually small parts she has done much better br br arnold moss as her father gives new meaning to the term ham and is the only actor ever on 1960s star trek episode that outdid william shatner in this area and actually makes shatner look superb by comparison and he gets to play shakespearian actor no less which gives him more impetus to overact and he does so br br other than these two leads being so weak the story is such that anybody with any sense at all can tell who the killer is within the first 15 minutes say this because told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre teens his reply was yeah you re right br br skip this one and watch the much superior menagerie episodes which were originally televised right before &#39;,
 &#39; remember watching this film while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland it all came flooding back why this hasn had video or dvd release yet it sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn been released in fact haven seen it on the tv either since the day watched it kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis this is definitely role he was born to play john carpenter break from horror brought this gem that d love the tv to play again it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes belting out most of elvis greatest hits with gusto think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make number of great movies escape from new york the thing big trouble in little china and escape from a someone has got to release this before someone does remake or their own version of his life which feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has if this doesn get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel &#39;,
 &#39; to be honest did never read one of the comics and cannot remember part 2 and 3 at all can compare to the first part werner beinhart and this one here is really disappointing compared to part1 as well as compared to most other movies watched the last weeks the first minutes seam to be just needless clone of the first movie intro and then it is becoming even worse there are few good funny scenes but in total it is just another boring second rate try of german film industry that cannot succeed nearly as usual one good thing the movie is quite short 75 min the bad thing it only contains story and jokes for 45 minutes don watch it &#39;,
 &#39; dug this out and watched it tonight honestly think it must be 20 years since the last time saw it remember it being seriously flawed film don remember it being this bad br br am absolutely aghast that project with this much potential should have been mistreated so reprehensibly who am to blame for this the 2 guys who wrote and use that word loosely the script the casting directors who so terribly miscast at least 3 major characters in the story only 2 of them are among the amazing 5 the director who clearly refused to take it seriously and kept shoving awful music on top of bad writing bad acting everywhere liked the theme song but it should never have been used all the way throughout the entire film don black who should be ashamed at some of the lyrics he wrote for that music br br it figures that should pull this out less than week after re reading the comic book adaptation the first 15 20 minutes of the film more or less really less parallel the first issue of the comic as watched it tonight kept wondering why was almost every single detail changed doc showing up then using his wrist watch remote control to open the safe and the sniper bullet missing him by 5 inches because the refractive glass were just about the only things left the same mean if you re gonna do an adaptation why in god name change everything br br once they leave doc hq virtually nothing is as it was in the comic which given roy thomas figure probably follows the book read somewhere they actually combined elements of 2 different novels into one movie again why ve heard it was changed because they weren able to secure the kind of budget they wanted look at the film and think lack of money in no way explains what saw on the screen br br you know when people complain about joel schumacher they should really take look at this thing the best thing can say is think it would make great double feature with the 1966 batman feature and probably great triple bill with that and the 1980 flash gordon all 3 films are silly maybe we can blame the 1966 film and tv series for this some fans have complained over the years that adam west batman ruined the image of comic books in the minds of generations of non comics fans think the same could be said for hollywood m reminded of how many really really bad films based on classic characters have been made over the years especially it seems to me in the late 70 early 80 charlie chan fu manchu tarzan buck rogers flash gordon the lone ranger all murdered by hollywood types who think oh comic books so you know it supposed to be stupid more like they re the stupid ones what waste of potential br br let me say some good things despite the script and the directing ron ely is great when read doc savage story don think of the james bama paintings think of ely bill lucking who later was regular on the team is terrific eldon quick who ve seen somewhere else but can recall where is terrific paul gleason who absolutely hated with passion and vengeance in the breakfast club teachers like the one he played should be banned from ever teaching anywhere may be the best of the amazing 5 in the film pamela hensley though her part was almost unrecognizable from the original story is terrific before she let her hair down also realized she looked hell of lot like ardala valmar from those awful john calkins buck rogers strips just read the other day she got big nose like ardala only not quite as pronounced the comics ardala actually looked more like the 1936 movie princess aura or cher or maybe streisand take yer pick ardala actually got plastic surgery in the george tuska strips after she was stunning br br paul wexler funny enough saw just last week in get smart episode wonder if he was anything like the character he was supposed to be playing don know because that character sure wasn in the movie the film takes its title from &#39;,
 &#39; this film has its good points hot chicks people die br br the problem the hot chicks barley get nude and you don get to see many of the people dieing mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes br br also for those of you watching this for jenna jameson she is just side chearator with very small role and minor nude scenes br br what this film needed script and story would be nice but will not complain about that simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks br br wouldn waste my money on it and if you must wait until it on the old shelves at your local video store &#39;,

 &#39; most of the bad reviews on this website blame hood of the living dead for one or more of the following reasons 1 it is low budget movie with virtually no acting 2 it was so bad it made me laugh 3 it is something could do myself won even discuss the first point because it is very subjective matter whether you like low budget and independent stuff or not must say however that still fail to understand people renting such movie as hood of the living dead and then looking surprised when they realize it is not as polished and cute as romantic comedy with lindsay lohan or matthew mc conaughey as for the second point really don see what so wrong with laughing personally like to laugh and love movies that make me to be they comedies or horror flicks when in hammerhead saw this girl stepping into puddle and the shark man came out of it to eat her just cracked up and was grateful that the director made such stupid scene and gave me ten seconds of pure fun honestly laughing just makes me feel good while it seems that many people writing reviews see it as bad bad thing if you only want to feel sad and scared while watching movie hood of the living dead and low budget flicks are definitely not for you but please don come and tell us that you find them laughable we already know it this is most probably why we decided to watch the movie in first place however it is the third point that leaves totally baffled just several years ago people were lining up out of theaters to see blair witch project which is way more rudimentary boring plot less and bad acted movie than hood of the living dead and takes itself way too seriously too moreover half million people go on youtube every day to see the short films of lonelygirl15 which is certainly something everyone with cute girlfriend room and webcam could do not to talk about all of the even more amateurish videos you can find there why don people blame those clips for bad acting and non existing plot think it is one of the best things of our times that everyone with affordable technology and bunch of friends can make their own movies and share them with people that have similar interests and feel certain admiration for people who spend their weekends with their friends making honestly bad yet refreshing piece of trash like this rather than shopping at the mall or playing video games alone leave aside your biases and your desire to sound like smart film critic by attacking movies and you ll see that hood of the living dead can bring you almost as much fun as it did to its makers if you have taste for refreshing and enjoyable home made horror movies recommend zombiez the ghosts of edendale the killer eye monster man don look in the basement the worst horror movie ever made redneck zombies jesus christ vampyre slayer and habit &#39;,
 &#39; this was great anime true the animation is old but its still worth watching and has better plot than ninja scroll the problem that it was kinda long br br japanese movie star hiroyuki sanada who played ujio from last samurai played the main character jiro and it was directed by rintaro who did galaxy express 999 and metropolis br br the anime has some good animation for an old anime interesting characters like the main villain tenkai and ando shouzan and of course lets not forget the beautiful musical scores in the film br br all in all this movie is worth watching for fans of anime animation in general action and samurai ninja flicks despite the lows in the film that didn the film from being great film to watch br br don miss this film &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is nothing short of dark gritty masterpiece may be bias as the apartheid era is an area ve always felt for but d say it ranks right up with cry freedom and cry the beloved country sadly up until few days ago d never even heard of this movie inside is one of the most underrated films of all time probably because it was small film company d never even heard of it before eric stoltz one of my favorite actors anyway is believable and dramatic nigel hawthorne plays his dastardly role well do not look for humor in this film there is none it is real savage and gritty to the last and to the sensitive d say bring box of tissues but movies as great as this make you wonder why is it that the greatest films are often never heard of &#39;,
 &#39; okay here the thing ve read through the comments of other viewers some trashing the film and some saying it the funniest darkest blackest comedy ever made whiffs of tarantino etc well not exactly but guess what it still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film not brilliant not trash liv tyler gives great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her she a woman with very strong decorating ideas matt dillon greatly underrated and under used actor is wonderful as ever he always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully ditto john goodman though the religious overtones probably funny in the script really don work paul reiser is very good definitely better than he was on tv br br the usually unbearable michael douglas is actually great in this role as for his coif well see the film between this and wonder boys you re actually reminded of the fact that douglas can act the movie will make you laugh in parts okay not exactly belly laughing but definitely in the m amused m very amused category if you re renting this expecting to see another pulp fiction forget it but if want something kinda hip and kinda fun this is damned good choice &#39;,
 &#39; if you like bad movies and you must to watch this one here a good one not quite as funny as the first but much lower quality must see for fans of jack frost as well as anyone up for good laugh at the writing &#39;,

 &#39; had mixed feelings for les valseuses 1974 written and directed by bertrand blier when started watching it but ended up liking it would not call it vulgar dumb and dumber is vulgar the sweetest thing is both vulgar and unforgivably stupid would call it shocking and offensive can understand why many viewers especially the females would not like or even hate it it is the epitome of misogyny or so it seems and the way two antiheroes treat every woman they meet seems unspeakable but the more think of it the more realize that it somehow comes off as delightful little gem am fascinated how blier was able to get away with it the movie is very entertaining and highly enjoyable it is well written the acting by all is first class and the music is sweet and melancholic actually when think of it two buddies had done something good to the women they came across to they prepared woman in the train the lovely docile blonde brigitte fossey who started her movie career with one of the most impressive debuts in renã clã ment forbidden games 1952 at age 6 for the meeting with her husband whom she had not seen for two months they found man who was finally able to get frigid marie ange miou miou exited and satisfied they enlightened and educated young and very willing isabelle huppert in one of her early screen appearances their encounter with jeanne moreau elevates this comedy to the tragic level in short am not sure d like to meet gã rard depardieu jean claude and patrick dewaere pierrot in real life and invite them over for dinner but had good time watching the movie and two hours almost flew it was never boring &#39;,

 &#39; in order to stop her homosexual friend albert perry king from being deported back to belgium stella meg foster decides to marry him the only other problem with that is that stella herself is lesbian the two have their separate lives when one night after albert birthday party they fall into bed and then into love later in the film after falling in love stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing what she finds will leave the viewer stunned this is great film very original perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here very controversial upon its release in 1978 the rated film is now pg in this much more liberal time br br recently released on dvd the disc contains making of segment on the special features and in it it stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved &#39;,
 &#39; find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream hollywood movies like indiana jones and the temple of doom american graffiti and howard the duck would begin their career with low budget exploitation horror film like this perhaps as testament to the talent that would earn willard hyuck and gloria katz an oscar nomination later in their respective careers messiah of evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can muster the film making prowess to pull it off br br the premise involves young girl who travels to small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing while back it doesn take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe messiah of evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror br br the surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon young couple in seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct research on the local legend of the blood moon scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great elisha cook jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father paintings from the shop and last but not least retarded murderous squirrel eating albino br br part of the movie charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way whereas with lynch it is obviously the mark of talented creator with messiah of evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didn really expect it to come out this way but it good enough wrap scene blur hopelessly br br take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father voice as she reads his diary br br while we re still talking about living dead picture messiah of evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what zombie movie is supposed to be the origin of the living dead here is 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by mysterious dark stranger who came from the woods one day in the meantime hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in flesh eating supermarket scene that predates dawn of the dead by good number of years you can hear the mst3k line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in movie theater br br generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it not hidden within the perfectly normal hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand when the albino for example picks up girl hitching her way to town and eats squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks br br the general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either add to that the choppy editing average acting and hyuck general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and d file messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it not particularly gory trashy or sleazy &#39;,
 &#39; in the wasteland that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly manna from heaven br br in what could best be described as cute movie approximately 350 years of movie acting experience allright give or take 100 years joyously lights up the screen to tell tale of deceit remorse and redemption about catholic family in buffalo ny br br truly well positioned to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton sisters five sisters productions company will leave smile on your face and joy in your heart all while renewing your faith in mankind br br from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in small non descript house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you ve never been to buffalo you ll leave the theater with thoughts of shuffling off for visit shots of the city landmarks and surroundings help to bring quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great lakes compliments rather than detracts from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country second cities instead of running off to soundstage somewhere the end results would be so much more believable br br great performances by shirley jones frank gorshin wendy malick jill eickenberry and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent outlasts hollywood flavor of the week any time br br go see this movie br br you ve wandered in hollywood desert for too long &#39;,

 &#39; was very surprised to see that this movie had such good rating when checked it on imdb after seeing it this really is one of the worst movies have ever seen and have seen many bad movies it looks like good movie in the beginning but when he comes into surgery couldn believe how bad it got this voice over destroys everything just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says saw the movie in german so don really know what he said in english but ironic stuff like yeah right it doesn hurt what is this telling yourself think about something else and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just stupid and his mother how the hell does she figure something like that out someone comes to tell her her son died in surgery what she kind of had to expect plus she found some letters in jessica albas bag plus that she knows the hospital stuff and then it takes her one second to figure it out what the hell and the ending why does the police bust them the patient died in surgery thats all that happened that drunk doctor doesn know anything else either and then they bust them all even the girlfriend why despite all that think christensen did bad job but that doesn really count for me those mistakes and stupid things wrote about above are the problem watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed as said one of the worst movies have ever seen just don watch it &#39;,
 &#39; this is great off the wall romantic comedy about love work pandering to the public taste and midlife crises the main character is talented movie director who decides to make silly pg 13 movie to get himself out of hock with the irs it has an excellent cast wide range of humor from deadpan to slapstick and fine writing it also wry send up of the movie industry the metacommentary includes several excellent cuts between reality and the movie that being made and in some places the film departs from strict realism the result is multi dimensional masterpiece of wry midlife humor &#39;,
 &#39; saw this film last night at pre code film festival and have to tell you that when gary cooper turned his head for his introductory close up the entire audience gasped he was just that beautiful br br cooper looks aside this film displays rouben mamoulian directorial artistry to perfection wonderful scene fades creative camera angles symbolic allusions mamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation br br this was sylvia sidney first role in hollywood after her success on the new york stage and she is just as lovely as gary cooper leading lady ought to be it nice to see her in role with harder edge than many she was given so often she looks like she afraid she about to be hit by someone br br there are lots of familiar faces in this film including the wonderful wynne gibson most striking is guy kibbee best known for playing fatuous rich men as grinning and mendacious hit man br br there aren nearly enough of these pre code films available on vhs or dvd so if you can find pre code festival near you try campaigning turner classic movies for broadcast as for the reviewer who believes gary cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than yep or nope he should perhaps consider coop performance in films such as mr deeds goes to town or meet john doe although heaven knows anyone who looked that good shouldn have to be smart as well &#39;,
 &#39; started to watch this show by accident but love it the fact that main character is in wheelchair is something that lacking in television especially for kids shows my five year old nephew as most children do would just stare at people who were in wheelchairs or had some other type of handicap but after he watched pelswick it just seemed to be normal occurrence to him every time he saw wheelchair he would simply say like pelswick and go on with what ever he was originally doing and yes the animation is little crude but if you can stand to watch through the first season of the simpsons then this isn that bad the genie is actually an angel who is there to help pelswick learn lessons in life he can not walk some else said he could walk some of the time ve seen every episode and he never to my recollection walked he is paraplegic he has no feeling below his armpits he mentions it in an episode as for the humor if you can get copy of the ntalented episode which lampoons boy bands you will instantly love this show &#39;,
 &#39; this film for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the bloc buster violent thriller mystery murder movies that abound it is about real people making the best of their lives they just happen to be indian and the main characters are in law enforcement the realistic acting and the great scenery more than make up for the slightly implausible plot the sound track is by bc smith who also did the soundtrack for coyote waits and is great adam beach plays tribal policeman who is little bit accident prone and wes studi is the stoic consummately professional detective there are many other fine either supporting or cameo roles by graham greene tantoo cardinal etc we have also seen coyote waits another adaptation of hillerman novel and we greatly enjoyed it too &#39;,
 &#39; william shakespeare the merchant of venice is about jewish moneylender and his bond to extract pound of flesh from the wealthy merchant antonio the forfeiter of debt the jewish moneylender of course is shylock and he is given such towering performance by al pacino that even outstanding actors like jeremy irons joseph fiennes and lynne collins fade into the background the film is set in 16th century venice and director michael radford relies on setting mood and realism to tell its story rejecting lavish period costumes or modern setting with rock music to appeal to wider audience br br radford slices the play three hour length to manageable two hours and eight minutes and also provides some historical background in the opening narration he tells us how jews came to england were subject to increasing persecution and eventually expelled from england they were forbidden to own property could make profits only by lending money at interest and were forced to live in venetian geto forerunner of darker events to come in the film the merchant antonio jeremy irons spits upon shylock in public yet feels no shame in going to the usurer to borrow 3000 ducats to help his friend and suggested lover bassanio joseph fiennes to properly court portia lynne collins wealthy heiress though shylock has been insulted by antonio he agrees to loan the money without interest for three months on the condition that forfeiture of the bond grants him the right to exact pound of flesh from antonio heart br br the play is primarily drama of hatred and revenge but like many of shakespeare works there are touches of broad comedy as well here the comedy involves three pairs of lovers bassanio and portia gratiano bassanio friend and nerissa and lorenzo another friend of bassanio and jessica shylock daughter portia has offered herself to the person who can pick the right treasure from one of three boxes made of gold silver and lead the prince of morocco chooses the one of gold the prince of aragon the one of silver and both are disappointed bassanio however loves her for herself and opens the leaden casket to find the portrait within radford adaptation conveys remarkable feeling for time and place portia residence at belmont suggests one of those splendid summer homes complete with immaculate gardens and art treasures hanging in every room and contrasts well with the grungy look of shylock city with its dank alleyways br br when it becomes clear that antonio cannot repay the debt bassanio returns to venice leaving portia behind when he arrives the loan is in default and shylock is demanding his pound of flesh even when bassanio backed by portia wealth offers many times the amount in repayment shylock is intent on revenge not only for the loss of the money but for lifetime of outsider status the duke who sits in judgment will not intervene as portia enters in the guise as lawyer to defend antonio it is here that the film reaches its dramatic heights as all parties come to court to achieve final resolution br br the merchant of venice is not only about an unpaid debt but also about the estrangement of jews from christian society and their desire for belonging it has been one of shakespeare most controversial plays and analysts have debated for long time whether it is an anti semitic play or simply play about anti semitism that reflects the prevalent view of christian society in elizabethan england although shylock is definitely caricature he is an ambiguous figure and there are many indications that shakespeare views his flaws as human failings not jewish ones the duke recognizes that he is simply man who has failed to adhere to the compassionate language of the torah br br in the monologue am jew hath not jew eyes â if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die and if you wrong us shall we not revenge shylock shows universal humanity expressing the equality of all men though we are horrified at the sentence he wishes to carry out we can feel his pain accumulated over the years pacino performance brings new vigor to the text and his often over the top persona is replaced with gentler more understated demeanor that brings understanding to his cause during toronto international film festival interview last september radford said about pacino â when you work with brilliant actor you have great machine it a bit like driving powerful car you have to dare to do it he has dared and we are all the beneficiaries &#39;,

 &#39; hayao miyazaki magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser ponyo on the cliff by the sea his latest animated film which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic and didn have to wait for an invite to make sure got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie scheduled to open here next week br br for fans of studio ghibli films you ll probably know what you re in for as miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography that will win new fans over m embarrassed to say the least that ve so far watched only my neighbour totoro eyes that pile of ghibli dvds and love it to bits but guess this would serve as final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that would enjoy br br ponyo voiced by nara yuria is magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea with her constant forays in bubble to the surface of the water to sneak peek nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad fujimoto tokoro joji who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution and briefly touching subplot on environmental protection revenge by mother nature as well an accident one day sees ponyo being washed ashore and picked up by five year old boy sosuke doi hiroki who lives on house on the said cliff with his mother lisa yamaguchi tomoko while dad koichi nagashima kazushige is mostly out to sea since he a sailor and you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of the little mermaid or splash made for kids saying anything more would be to spoil the fun br br the artwork here is still simply astounding even though it in 2d glory knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on there are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame that you ll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all this definitely beats any 3d or cg animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity and not only from the artwork department but on its story too despite complaints coming in that it took leaf from the hans christian andersen classic while there are avenues to make this film extremely dark it only suggested certain dark themes but opted instead for film with more positive emotions suitable for both kids and adults alike br br at its core its about love that between the family members of koichi lisa and sosuke and especially between mother and son more so it about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened ponyo and tell you ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of bolt walle and eve all hands down characterization here is top notch and it hard not to fall in love with ponyo in whichever form adopted especially when she such playful being who doesn hide her emotions if she upset with you either she turns away or you could expect jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face br br ponyo on the cliff by the sea is definite shoo in to my top films of this year without hesitation and the next time go to tokyo m sure as hell going to make my way to the ghibli museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by hayao miyazaki highly recommended film so don you go missing this on the big screen &#39;,
 &#39; don usually write comment when there are so many others but this time feel have to have spoken of taste in another review saying it all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad taste br br love films loved isle of the dead which is pretty much an unknown w film even liked scream and scary movie liked these films because they have if not lot at least something good about them appreciate 99 9 of the films ve seen because they tell story which haven heard before and most directors only make films with good storyline throughout this film was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be joke and suchlike with the obvious twist looming was sceptical but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove hadn wasted my time was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any glimmer of hope there was here a rundown storyline â much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are cringeworthy and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didn make me feel thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think oooo wasn that clever because it wasn in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where tyler true identity was cryptically shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was meaningless attempt at an awesome twist think it was wild things that had like pretty poor double twist and still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn trying too hard to be big twist its like the ci2 writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just bad story with bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by sebastian whole story build up meaning nothing and horrible half forced paedophilic ending with particularly young and innocent acting girl acting â the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad sunset beach extremely corny and badly performed it not even so bad it good like hunk the worst acting thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor haven seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film also br br can even say it is good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film d be ashamed but they wouldn anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make good film which this film has none of really m disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age bracket for this film and so dislike it like all the films now that liked as teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly don like any teenish story lines no liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills 90210 all the time there no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay m afraid besides was 16 17 when first watched it if anything being older just makes you better judge of terrible film can believe anyone can give it 10 10 either one of my favourite films is memento and gave it 9 as know there can be better it is shame for this site that people do that give 10s flippantly or don get the films show and so give it 2 br br anyone who liked this film really should vary their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than loch ness br br if you aren a teenager with bad taste or simply don have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film &#39;,
 &#39; this movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi actioner the hidden and dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles but someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one br br dolph plays butt kicking monk who travels to new york to retrieve key that unlocks door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years he must battle the minion who is spirit that jumps from body to body much like the hidden and jason goes to hell the minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and dolph are chased by the minion possessed bodies br br if m making this sound entertaining forget it the pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career br br the cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is snoozefest br br too bad really wanted to like this &#39;,
 &#39; can get this flick off my brain it definitely totally different than anything that out there ve seen ton of movies over the holidays and while some are okay nothing really rocked my world the way blindspot did there is just something way cool about the actors and the way that they put the film together it like there is really scary stuff mixed with with some pretty ing hilarious black humour franco is great but the older rough dude steals the show in few scenes like when he punches the kid out in the dirt grave guess some politically correctos won appreciate the vibe don bring your grandma but it is totally awesome the thing that best is the kaliedescope style there is some really serious stuff mixed with super interesting footage of the road the movie really makes you sad and scared in parts but it also spins your head with what is happening and the way it is filmed wtf is up with the world sooo many critics are raving about all these supposedly revolutionary ground breaking films and when you see them they re boring and predictable and not all that don get it because there are lot of other better choices blind spot is really kinda great because it gives you thrills and chills and major upcoming star power but does it in way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad &#39;,
 &#39; man castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called hoovervilles named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration the proposition of this film is that man home is still his castle even when it just shack in hooverville br br spencer tracy has such shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much but in part very typical for tracy before he was cast as priest in san francisco the start of slew of classic roles he playing tough good natured mug who takes in loretta young br br one of the things about man castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men women had some additional strains put on them if men had trouble finding work women had it twice as hard and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for square meal spence takes loretta young in who facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle pretty soon though they re in love though tracy is not the kind to settle down br br the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having torrid affair during the shooting of man castle and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously br br also in the cast are walter connolly as kind of father figure for the whole camp marjorie rambeau who been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well hohl brings the plot of man castle to its climax through his scheming br br man castle is grim look at the great depression not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment &#39;,
 &#39; janeane garofalo has been very public in her displeasure about this film calling it among other things anti feminist she has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she doesn believe in them wholeheartedly agree with janeane here this film is trifle at best she does her best but overall it was just another boring unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get romantic film from hollywood janeane character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness which makes her look unattractive while uma character is filmed in lighter tones which probably displeased janeane and is probably one of the reasons she detests this film that really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that janeane is supposed to be the better looking of the two as many have said here and on other comment threads janeane is not ugly but in fact quite beautiful haven read one review where someone said uma was better looking having said that though believe that ben chaplin character would more than likely stay with uma not janeane many men don like really intelligent women and many women don like really intelligent men and sadly ben probably would have stayed with uma and despite the director attempt to make janeane unattractive it doesn work her natural beauty comes through anyway br br think lot of janeane male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the ben chaplin character and actually scoring with janeane janeane is lot more complicated than the character she plays here real life is always much more complex than hollywood can imagine so take cold shower gentlemen this is the role that janeane is best known for and that a shame as this really isn that good of film &#39;,
 &#39; there are several things wrong with this movie brenda song character being one of them do not believe that the girl is lousy actor honestly don i believe she is given poor lines she is just supposed to be that vain rich girl and while it is funny in the tv shows she plays in it can even get dry laugh from me here br br either way really should have known what to expect when sat down to watch this film br br the movie was not that terrible initially wendy reaction to shen was completely natural mean how would you feel if man claiming to be reincarnated monk chased you around commanding you to wear medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight the great evil and save the world which brings me to another point know this movie is entirely fiction but it is still has founding in chinese culture it seems like all of the warriors in wendy family line were women correct me if m wrong but doubt that the monks would ve just been okay with that sure maybe they could ve worked it in somehow but they offered no explanation whatsoever by doing so they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by hollywood and the media br br nevermind that however let us continue br br wendy character becomes more unbearable as the film go on yes she is teenager and it is near homecoming mean who wants to fight evil during homecoming the problem is when the evil starts to manifest himself wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be she is extremely careless even for someone like her she continues not to care about her training will use this conversation as an example shen if you do not win this battle evil will take over and everything good will be gone wendy whoa talk about pressure well let talk about something else yes let wendy let also go dancing when you should rightfully be training of course shen lets her but his character has an excuse better that he cooperate with her than that he not and she not train at all and get them both killed br br oh speaking of which shen also told wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle as he had for her great grandmother am assuming that part br br this makes wendy actions more unforgivable br br as the script writer would have it wendy homecoming and this great battle are on exactly the same day do you know what wendy does do you even have to guess yes she does end up going to the battle for when she tries to leave for homecoming the monks who shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she felt weird fighting an old man inform her that shen has gone to battle alone so she goes to save him br br we initially see some half decent fighting that is actually entertaining until finally the great evil comes out of wendy rival for homecoming body and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors br br don ask br br anyway wendy gets all panicky then shen goes and defends her from this guy forgive me for forgetting his long chinese name and manages to get himself killed br br wendy catches shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air br br she screams title of said article out br br now it was bad enough that wendy became powerful far far too fast no will not let it be excused because it was her destiny and she had the power within her br br since when though did she learn healing no worst since when could she resurrect people so shen is raised from the dead then wendy and he fight the guy br br he loses way to easily the worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time and he is banished forever then the monks commend wendy on her sacrifice br br two things 1 don the script writer and director know battle needs little more finesse to it 2 what sacrifice the fact that she didn go to homecoming because the girl did not break sweat or even bleed mean come on now this movie was tv pg wanted to see somebody get hurt br br ah hem moving on br br know it sounds like maybe should have given the movie one based on my comments part of critique you must know though is breaking thing down you don necessarily try to look for the bad but if it there you bring attention to it this movie has lot of bad but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place br br so suppose it was all right not that me not saying it wasn all right would ve stopped anybody from watching it &#39;,
 &#39; liked this lot br br the camera angles are cool it not all jumpy like blair witch and thought they did great job with the sound when we see things from kane point of view lots of fun plenty of people were shouting at the screen br br kane did great job with his various psycho emotions he a lot less one dimensional than most horror heroes br br kane is lot less scary and more believable than most movie psychos it was not clear to me how he would react to various situations there are not many twists here but it is clever and original in it own way good creepy movie slasher fare &#39;,
 &#39; what about scream baby scream is supposed to make me not feel like fool for buying it bought it because god help me m sucker for old cinema even as worthless as this nonetheless something about this movie irritates me it probably janet janet comes off cold snooty seemingly with the intention of coming off as deep and noble with look on her face that screams constipation she can seem to agree to anything her uptight boyfriend wants m glad that this is her only role what really irritates me is that this is 1960 gore film gone terribly awry and as we all know awry is floridian for zero gore it like the director started with herschell lewis style but backed out of the gore scenes when his wife found out so instead we end up with one dull conversation after the other and basically whole lot of irritating nothing in other words we end up with florida bore joseph adler should be embarrassed janets boyfriend jason is almost as ridiculous as she is this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything come to think of it he probably the least likable good guy in horror history the only thing this movie really has going for it is that it carries that 60 early 70 b gore vibe that you can find in stuff like undertaker his pals blood freak or most anything from herschell lewis even rodney from the gruesome twosome is in this ithought his caveman comedy routine was irritating most everything from reel to reel is stupid even the trip scene was stupid the only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery but that mostly includes janet whining about life not being perfect in the only real ironic twist scream baby scream gets even less interesting once the story finally gets started around the 45 minute mark if you happen to be indifferent to whether or not your entertainment is watchable but are offended by the color red you might not hate this why does troma distribute this wouldn this be something weird video area scream baby scream very well may be the worst in florida horror gore of its era but suppose underneath the unlikeable characters and the incoherent plot lies potential scream baby scream really just seems like it should follow the blood feast pattern so to steal quote from janet if it doesn fit throw it out 2 10 &#39;,
 &#39; recently viewed copy of this under the title eaten alive talk about dreadful any movie ed wood ever put out looks like oscar material compared to this laughable tosh to be fair couple of lines from the script will live long in the memory such as these people cannibals don buy frozen meat from supermarket like us they get it fresh everyday from folk like you or me classic the mad jonesville type leader out in the jungle was the best character in the film he really did look like nutter think he was the only actor not to be dubbed in badly if these italians must have american characters in their films why dont they get americans to dub in the dialogue instead of english people trying their best to sound like annie oakley ll give this 3 out of 10 ll give it three because it really is funnier than most comedies out these days &#39;,
 &#39; the photography is accomplished the acting is quite good but in virtually every other department the greek tycoon is dreary bore taking its inspiration from the real life love affair of jackie kennedy and aristotle onassis the film is glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on tv all day long viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here but those who prefer films with bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time butt numbing slog br br american president james cassidy james franciscus and his beautiful wife liz jacqueline bisset are in greece on official business ridiculously wealthy greek shipping tycoon theo tomasis anthony quinn catches sight of liz at party at his elegant manor despite the fact that both of them are married to someone else there is an immediate attraction between them later at private party aboard his yacht tomasis makes his desires known to liz some while later president cassidy is assassinated whilst out strolling on beach liz is shocked and saddened by his death but it isn long before she seeks comfort in the arms of her greek lover tomasis eventually the two of them are married and their love affair becomes favourite talking point for the world newspapers magazines photographers and wags br br it is somewhat amusing to note the vigour with which the producers of this film denied that it was dramatisation of the kennedy onassis story they wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction but anyone with brain can see from where the movie is drawing its inspiration even aristotle onassis himself knew the greek tycoon amounted to his love life getting the hollywood treatment if rumours are to be believed he actually had hand in approving anthony quinn for the tomasis role lee thompson isn really the right sort of director for this type of movie â he better suited to action fodder like the guns of navarone and ice cold in alex â but he marshals the proceedings with an uninspired professional adequacy quinn is very watchable as tomasis bisset looks lovely as the object of his desires franciscus uses his toothy smile and faã ade of integrity to make for believable politician their performances are good on the surface but there little for the actors to do on any deeper level similarly tony richmond photography gives the film an elegant surface sheen as it moves from one exotic locale to the next but the merest of scratches proves that there nothing behind the film glossy exterior &#39;,
 &#39; one dark night is highly overlooked and little known film from the early 80 that deserves an audience that fear it will never get and that a damn shame have seen this film compared to others that have gotten bigger name over the years most notably phantasm hell night and mausoleum this is much different film than those and don see the comparisons other than the mausoleum which is bit similar to the one in phantasm but not enough to make any real comparisons m not sure how this one slipped through without broader acceptance maybe it all in the marketing don know perhaps remake would breathe new life into it unless raymar drained all the life out of it that is m not too big on all the remakes that are abundant these days but think they do work well with lesser known films except for the awful ghost ship remake which other than the opening scene and mudvayne not falling blaring was utter crap so if remake of one dark night would happen to fall into the right hands think it would make lot of people go and watch the original know that what do if there a remake of film haven seen before so anything short of remake fear would not bring this film back to life unless of course raymar got his eyes on it br br anyways one dark night is must see for horror fans especially 80 horror fans cause we all know that when the best horror movies were made creepy setting fairly good acting very good story campy what more could you want from an early 80 horror film what that nudity and gore well sorry no nudity or gore in this film but it still great nonetheless solid 8 out of 10 enjoy &#39;,

 &#39; peter lorre turns in one of his finest performances as hungarian watchmaker coming to the united staes to make new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him lorre infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in hotel fire and when no one will give him chance to work turns reluctantly to life of crime lorre range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial good natured immigrant to his depressing melancholic disfigured self searching for the truth behind what he believed america afforded him to his suave intelligent better than your average hood to his sympathetic dealings with blind woman with whom he falls in love the story is well paced has some interesting twists and gives lorre many opportunities to shine director robert florey does quality job behind the lens and all of the supporting cast help aid the film with evelyn keyes giving particularly good turn as the blind girl loved the ending and the truth that was shone to exist in lorre character despite all the negative things society had done toward him for little picture the man behind the mask is good movie making for its time &#39;,

 &#39; am fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60s films so ridiculous and silly that they are good for laugh so because of this it natural that d choose this film especially because with john agar in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad sadly while it was bad film it was the worst type of bad film dull beyond belief and unfunny at least with stupid and over the top bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy bad listless and dull br br the film begins with some young adults going to satan hollow to neck well considering the name of the place it not surprising when they are later found chewed to pieces duh don go necking at satan hollow well there are reports of some sort of crashing object from the sky so what do the teens go yep throw dance party very very very slow dance party where the kids almost dance in slow motion so it up to the sheriff agar and his men to ensure that the teens can dance in peace without fear of mastication br br as for the monster it some guy in gorilla suit with silly mask bit like the monster in robot monster not exactly original and not exactly high tech to make it worse it makes snorting noises and moves very very slowly so slow that even the most corpulent teen could easily outrun it how it manages to kill repeatedly is beyond me br br overall too dull to like even if you are fan of lousy cinema &#39;,
 &#39; absolutely love this movie evil dead has nothing on this film night of the demons 2 and 3 are total bore fest but this one is classic it super cheesy and the acting is alright at best but what more could you want from an 80 horror movie stooge has some of the best one liners to ever hit the screen in this one he my favorite character lot of people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie but my personal favorite is the ending sadly enough has nothing to do with the main characters when the old man eats his left over halloween apples in pie and his throat is mangled from the inside out the sound track is awesome the scene with angela dancing is totally creepy especially after the strobe light comes on and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of camera shutter click on the song that playing the make up effects in this movie are pretty sweet angela gave me nightmares as kid if you re the type of person who demands perfection out of your filming experience you might want to give this one pass but if you re like me and you really dig the whole halloween haunted house with the demons clichã than this one is definitely must own &#39;,
 &#39; this film is one of the best shorts ve ever seen and as make it point to be at all the major film festivals ve seen lot especially of what the industry considers the best m not fan of monaghan his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so generally try to avoid his films did however happen to see this at film festival few years back and was completely awed this director really knows what she doing of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who don understand what constitutes good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what ve seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gem br br let not deny that the film was working on no budget and that couple of the supporting actors could still use work because that certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for first real film from someone still in high school pretend for moment that the budget doesn matter if you take away bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasn the fault of the filmmaker saw this at festival and the sound was fine guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on mini dv then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawless br br nanavati can tell story that much is clear she can write substance heavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound post production and 35mm instead of mini dv and even the trolls couldn complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made good few years ago she done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and can wait to see the higher budget stuff she done 9 10 stars this is one hell of movie from one hell of filmmaker &#39;,
 &#39; watched this movie only because didn want to leave my 9 yo and her friend in the theater by themselves honestly went in expecting to enjoy good nap but found myself entranced by the movie d recommend it to anyone who asks roy mom was on one of my all time favorite tv shows years ago playing mermaid maximum bob she was really cute in this movie the three main characters were all excellent young actors also enjoyed seeing and hearing jimmy buffet the movie itself was quite beautiful showcasing some of what makes florida so great m glad ended up going to this movie and to think was disappointed that couldn take them to see stick it think this was much better &#39;,
 &#39; movie title tart br br date of review 5 26 02 br br year of movie 2001 br br stars dominique swain brad renfro bijou phillips barely melanie griffith barely br br necro rating 4 skulls out of 10 br br may contain spoilers br br plot br br an outcast dominique swain wants to be with the in group and so she abandons her real friends and joins them much annoying rich people talk occurs acting br br ugh guess got what wanted in that dominique was ok but man the rest of the cast besides maybe brad renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate them trust me like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they can convincingly be bad people br br it figures that the only other people got this for were barely even in it and that is melanie griffith and bijou phillips but the little time they had they were ok melanie spoke maybe 2 lines but at least bijou had good character although small br br violence and gore br br my mind was constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying characters that violence enough ok there was one bludgeoning with rock which was ok br br a nudity factor br br hahaha they couldn even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap if they are going to expose themselves they should do it in movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for oh hey heard she gets naked in this one br br overall view of the movie review br br ok ok know pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movies or at least find some good in it well this movie is one of the few really struggled to find anything worth while in the problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying already have deep hatred for snobby rich people attitudes and that didn help either all this movie really is is just bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid can stress the annoyance factor enough this movie tries to rehash the tried and true in group plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficulty br br why do not have pic from the movie or the box cover well felt this movie didn deserve that glory so decided to put pic of the reason rented this and that reason is none other than dominique swain yes too was wooed by her in lolita and thought she was so good that decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she acts at least keep my promises and yes have seen the majority of her movies minus few hard to find ones she herself is great actress and would defend her actively but man she chooses some of the crappiest movies to star in this movie and smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness but at least smokers had cool idea for story and even some real good scenes br br also the dvd box tries to fool you into thinking that this movie has stars as well in it by putting melanie griffith and bijou phillips names on the front of the box if there one thing that s me off it a movie that plasters the names of stars on box to make you think wow it has ____ wonder how good ___is in this one saw ___ in that movie and thought she was great only to have the big names in the movie for total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2 bijou actually had part that semi meant something melanie on the other hand only has 2 lines about granted don like melanie that much but this is about ethics and not star acting br br out of all this mess though props must go to brad renfro for turning in an ok performance along with dominique brad may be one very messed up kid in real life but at least he can act so the only reason this movie gets any skulls is because got what basically wanted which was dominique swain and brad renfro also had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress bijou phillips make me like her even more so even though was annoyed throughout still came out with some positives although this was pretty hard this time br br recommend you to only see this if you ve seen lolita and know how good dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of brad or bijou uber melanie fans will be sorely depressed also if you re fan of crappy movies like me please do not assume this be guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright for the money spent on buying or renting br br some movies are so bad that they are good as the saying goes what they forgot to add was so bad that they are good to pass up br br necro &#39;,
 &#39; loved this movie it is rare to get glimpse of post partum vietnam and this movie sans combat scenes and exciting bombs and gunfire did it had no idea d be so affected by it what an amazing look at how alien vets feel it was tough to watch quite frankly we all understand the fighting and the apocalypse now type of drama but this is so so different what happens when they come back and try to live life they can it made me very aware of large group of men that are rattling around lost in america not able to relate can sleep can have love affairs can deal with normal society they feel totally apart this is huge tragedy and one that isn addressed enough yeah we ve changed our attitude about vietnam vets we like them now but so what it doesn seem to have made any difference to them it too late so it was great film but cried lot have no other criticisms &#39;,
 &#39; cassavetes was clearly an intelligent sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films he wanted to be an auteur to break away from the confines of the system and bring new realism to the american cinema for that applaud him br br unfortunately as member of his audience cannot applaud woman under the influence cassavetes took what could have been fascinating topic an insane woman and somehow managed to craft dull film filled with lengthy ad libbed ranting and drawn out scenes he seems to have had gift for capturing the dullest moments of person life on film and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run this tactic would be acceptable if cassavetes had captured something devastatingly real or even kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways conventional film could not yet found the performances particularly rowlands to be artificial never believed for moment that she was really insane have met people who are truly mentally disturbed yet ve never seen any of them act quite like gena rowlands in woman under the influence she played it like very obnoxious uninhibited woman who drinks lot and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once at the beginning but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film there are some moments in which she taps into something real but those moments are few and far between she fails to sustain seamless mentally disturbed character again applaud her efforts but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true br br novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high imdb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly just to prove that they get it but don be brainwashed by the hype judge for yourself you don have to pretend to like it br br like woody allen john cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film making seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he couldn imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self indulgent but woody allen at least has demonstrated gift for keeping an audience entertained he knows that compelling story structure and good dose of humor are essential to any movie if cassavetes had employed some self discipline and sharp pair of editing shears woman under the influence could have stood chance but what the point of making realistic film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art house devotees and film students who worship cassavetes as some sort of anti establishment deity without dumbing anything down believe cassavetes could have made woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot instead of presenting string of 30 minute long scenes of ad libbed arguments if you just make films for yourself and few of your fans you re just reaching the already converted watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it if you are truly moved and fascinated by it good for you &#39;,
 &#39; one of the better movies to come out of the 1980 this based on fact movie tells the story of disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on river bank and brags about it later to his friends what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it br br disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget the young cast does creditable job even keanu reeves in one of his earliest roles is better than usual of course there no reason for the character of layne crispin glover to be as crazed and off the wall as he is but that just glover being himself veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as loner who despite his own sordid past is saddened by the attitudes of this group of kids would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel roebuck as the young murderer he an under rated actor and aside from hopper his is probably the best performance in the film br br saw river edge for the first time long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels however didn catch all of it saw it in its entirety for the first time number of years later and now ve seen it again for what is probably the definitive time br br some potently affecting moments include madeleine constance forslund breakdown where she wails that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did also liked the scenes where matt reeves faces off with his disturbed younger brother joshua miller and when the teacher mr burkewaite jim metzler deplores the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care br br will never forget this film not as long as live it too saddening for that br br 10 10 &#39;,
 &#39; if any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one ve never seen dialogues be spoken in such rough way but having strong feeling the movie was disturbing at moments however the movie was terrible at editing the movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place like karisma is getting beat up and the same time srk is fighting comically with the police officers the ishq kamina song was very out of place on top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning the direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag about br br have to say that the actors were chosen very wisely without them this movie would not have an impact karisma kapoor has given her best role to date and this looks very good on her record after zubeidaa and fiza she looks pretty in the first half and ve never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her what is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date nana patekar was excellent as her father in law not much to say about him besides this is role made for him deepti naval as the mother in law was excellent especially in her final scene though she doesn have much to say her facial expressions and body language was good the other good performance was the little kid he was adorable and is sure to bring tears to the viewer eyes the movie was probably saved desperately by their performances sanjay kapoor was all right but he didn have much to do shahrukh khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role br br one thing that brought the audience to the theater was ishq kamina the song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song and boy aish is mad hot however the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever people may have come to the movie for aish but they won brag too much about it after wards hum tum miley was properly paced but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie damroo bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about dil ne pukara is too boring of song to get the mood of the movie despite the poor editing the performances alone make it must see &#39;,
 &#39; four great stories from master robert bloch adapted to the screen by the best actors in the field in the early seventies are the base of this excellent amicus production this was kind of movie very popular in the sixties till the mid seventies and it one of my favorite type of horror movies this one in particular shines for the episode sweets to the sweet where christopher lee is stalked by his evil little girl child heiress to her mother tradition great fun from start to finish and good to very good are also the other three episodes with the last one bit on the comic side but with the great addition of ingrid pitt the most famous vampress of the english cinema &#39;,
 &#39; am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself but just got back from this movie and felt had to express my opinions let me start by saying that am huge horror fan but what makes horror movie sure like to see even tiny bit of good script and character development know they often lack in horror movies but prom night looked like it didn even put forth any effort in that department next we all love suspense that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises yeah prom night had none of that of course we like terrifying killer prom night have that nope it has pretty boy with cute lil knife and when all else fails at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore and the occasional nude scene yeah well when you have horror movie rated pg 13 like prom night they leave that stuff out too so with all of these elements missing ask does this still count as horror movie nope d call it more of comedy people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when saw semi pro that was supposed to actually be comedy which also sucked but thats another story think am just going to have to give up on new horror all the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money the people went to see it with didn even know this was remake which made me mad wonder what will happen when there no more movies to remake where will horror go next &#39;,
 &#39; with the mixed reviews this got wasn expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised it a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing that breezy without being glib and good pace it looks good too in funky way apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and m one who liked it &#39;,
 &#39; this movie has some good lines but watching dillon less than masterful rourke impersonation just left me wanting to see the original like marisa tomei but she no faye dunaway br br also in my opinion the number one movie rule is to make the lead character someone you care about you might not love the character but you should care what happens to him this is achieved in barfly with the hilarious running gag about the fights with eddie the bartender the main fight in factotum is when completely unprovoked he stalks up to the lily taylor character in bar punches her to the floor and calls her whore br br the whole thing just didn work again some great lines some laugh out loud funny but as movie overall it a fail mediocre attempt at reinventing something that was brilliant and you can get past that next let remake breakfast at tiffany with kate hudson &#39;,
 &#39; discovering something the journey is so much more fun so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanizing than when you finally arrive at the destination falling in love is perhaps one of the most opulent feelings in the world you feel energized invigorated and alive you simply want to be around that person every second of the day and the very sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes aroused love and all the physical and emotional side effects that comes with it is pure bliss where it goes from here is anyone guess but when you first begin your journey together nothing can compare to it br br diane lane and richard gere play adrienne willis and dr paul flanner two emotionally scarred middle aged individuals in this film they are about to embark on that mystical journey together where love and the discovery of the emotions along the way will help save them br br lane is dealing with the typical jerk of an ex husband who still loves her but in her eyes only because the woman he cheated with no longer wants him as hurt as she was by him as much as she really dislikes him there is part of her that is actually considering taking him back why you might ask because in life and love sometimes comfort supersedes intelligence yes this man cheated on her but she has kids with him she built life with him and there is obviously still connection with him br br richard gere plays recently divorced husband and estranged father he also just lost patient as she reacted negatively to the anesthetic he is now being sued by her family and he is guilt ridden but hardened about the issue this is what brings him to rodanthe in the first place although his lawyer told him not to he felt compelled to visit the woman husband in rodanthe he stays at the inn that adrienne is taking care of soon they find comfort in each other arms and discover that they too can have second chance in life br br by now this sounds like simple idea for film and although it might be something you ve seen or read about before gere and lane simply own the film diane lane lights the screen up with her smile her eyes twinkle in the dark and the life she brings to the character is one worth watching gere character is little different he is more hardened and bitter it takes adrienne pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell he blames quietly himself for his strained relationship with his son and her secretly blames himself for the death of the patient on the outside he tells anyone who will listen that it is not his fault and that she was 1 in 50 000 casualty but deep down it eats away at him they find each other at time when both need someone to listen br br gere and lane have been in film together before but this is the first time they play lovers they were married in unfaithful but here they play lovers finding each other when the people in their lives have abandoned them they have spark and real chemistry would love to see more films with them together in fact d love to see more films with diane lane but that a story for another time br br nights in rodanthe is very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other they both become better people they both become stronger people enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to anyone not just couples this is film about redemption absolution and second chances br br it will also ask you to bring some hankies br br 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; although it isn mentioned very often don look in the basement is very interesting film and is definitely worth watch the story follows young nurse charlotte beale who is hired at stephen sanitarium to replace dr stephens after he is murdered by patient many patients begin to torment miss beale and her boss dr geraldine masters acts as if she hiding something br br this movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about and have sympathy for during the climax which doesn happen very often in horror films the musical score is great and is reminiscent of dark shadows the performance from rosie holotik rhea mcadams and bill mcghee are all great the story is very intriguing with great twist ending this movie has campy atmosphere around it that no other film have ever seen has been able to capture many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been horror classic don look in the basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive in films &#39;,
 &#39; only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so d know what not to pick up not only do get the original title but come to find terror hospital is one of seven more aliases this one is real clunker movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least mild form of entertainment mostly amusement this has none of that instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way too convenient for the situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film forget trying to figure out where anybody is or who they are during darkened or nighttime scenes too you probably won care anyway there is also random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver ed movies slep er mean sat through and watched way back in high school really we re talking about mysticism possession and killer on the loose here not bad recipe for trash cinema unfortunately there nothing here to make it even good trash when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not so special effects are just that bad acting and not so special effects this one just trash pure and simple leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale there a reason its there &#39;,
 &#39; raising victor vargas is just bad film no amount of denial or ad dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact br br maybe peter sollett saw he didn have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current edgy film making maybe he just doesn know any better it hard to tell br br what not hard to tell is the result except for few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film making into an attempt at pseudo realism few will enjoy it br br know didn br br do yourselves favor and pass on this film &#39;,
 &#39; currently this film is listed on imdb as the 42nd worst film ever made which is exactly why rented it from netflix however am saddened to report that the film while bad is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one hardly glowing endorsement but it just didn meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list br br the film begin with stewart moss and marianne mcandrew on their belated honeymoon by the way they are married in real life as well he a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to nearby cave once there they behave very very very stupidly hallmark of bad film and are soon bitten by bat according to this film bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the us both of which are not true at all br br oddly after being bitten the man doesn even bother going to the hospital the first thing on anyone mind especially doctor is to get medical help immediately but not this boob soon he having seizures yet he still isn interested in seeking help again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history br br after while he eventually goes to see doctor and is sent to the hospital but by then it too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood when it totally obvious to everyone that the man is crazed killing machine the wife who like her husband has grapefruit for brain refuses to believe he dangerous even after he attacks people steals an ambulance and runs police car off the road br br now most of the time moss is going through these episodes his eyes roll back and he looks like normal person oddly however couple times he develops bat like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat like had this been really cheesy the film would have merited 1 br br in the very end in twist that hardly made any sense at all the wife inexplicably turned into crazed bat lady and had swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff how all this was arranged was mystery as was moss and mcandrew belief that this film would somehow help their careers though they both have had reasonably long careers on tv playing bit roles since 1974 br br overall very dumb the plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real not good film at all but not among the worst films of all time either br br note for some reason imdb shows the graphic for the three dvd set for it alive and it two sequels of the web page for the bat people while the bat people has been seen with the title it alive the two movies are not at all related it easy to understand the mistake especially since they both came out in 1974 but the movie just reviewed starred stewart moss and marianne mcandrew and the other film starred john ryan and sharon farrell &#39;,
 &#39; if my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of comedy funny look at the adult entertainment industry if that what it supposed to be it doesn really work it just isn that funny setting that rather significant since this is called comedy failure aside since have no personal knowledge of the subject matter ll avoid comment about the authenticity of the story which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in toronto massage parlour except to say that if this is true the life is pretty dull br br for over an hour this movie really doesn give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls aren giving full service euphemism for actual sex as for the girls themselves betty goal is to buy parlour of her own so that she can run her own business cindy is an illegal immigrant to canada working to support her family back home and leah is well leah is somewhat strange undefined character with nipple fetish true who seems to be in the business because well because she in it have no idea what her character was about those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this business br br the movie meanders about and doesn offer much until the twist reveals conrad to be the bad guy we should have gotten to that point sooner the only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story conrad secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls that plan for revenge was pretty good and you re grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point you re wondering why you wasted your time with this had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been fairly funny movie br br the performances from the 4 leads were all ok although didn think anyone came across as outstanding all four characters were bit shallow cindy was sympathetic character and so was conrad for while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie given the subject matter there surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene in fact there even certain air of innocence around lot of this as for the overall quality of the movie it a low budget effort which shows although you expect certain griminess suppose of movie set in the context of body rub parlour so that forgivable it certainly says something though that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writer director soo lyu resume and given the normal lack of depth in the canadian film industry that it wasn even deemed worthy of being nominated for any genie awards the canadian version of the oscars 4 10 and m being bit generous with that &#39;,
 &#39; the idea of making film about the beatles sounds doomed idea as no production can catch the idea of the actual historic beatles then it is perhaps best not to try to recreate the past but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available beatles material this is exactly what birth of the beatles offers to us the simple story known to us without any extravaganza br br spoilers here on br br be warned that not everything is that accurate as some beatles graduates might expect the beatles are seen performing songs that hardly were even composed by that time the beatles perform ask me why s love you and even don bother me the beatles graduates should see that if the beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did at hamburg the younger viewers might not anymore recognize the beatles they have learned to know them of that original hamburg repertoire only johnny goode and stu sutcliffe love me tender are retained br br the guys who play the beatles in this production scarcely look like the originals but the rest of the film still make good viewing as the film is for the rest fairly accurate the guy who plays lennon does it good and the rest of the band are not bad either brian epstein is great and the moment when he sacks pete best from the group is probably the most memorable scene in the whole film also as bonus you get to see the original cavern club in the film &#39;,
 &#39; br br first viewed this film shortly after it was put out on video in 1995 dismissed it offhand saying that julie was no daniel never really giving it chance and saying it was horrid br br but here it is 5 years later its on disney and im watching it again and m finding that it isnt as bad as made it out to be miyagi is still miyagi just as kool as ever the musical score is still there pleasant as ever and swank character isnt that bad her acting is pretty good considering the script it beats the third installment by wide margin so my original rating of 4 has been raised to 7 &#39;,
 &#39; that is the answer the question is what is the single reason to watch this movie loved her in my name is julia ross that is one of the best films noir of all time noir or whatever one may call it it a very unsettling movie br br she is fun in one of the worst major studio releases of all time too that would be the guilt of janet ames this one has spooky promising title it has good cast it has fine director was expecting something dark maybe something little tawdry instead it an uninspired routine espionage movie it pretty much is total bore at least it was to me ms foch is captivating and that is about it &#39;,
 &#39; am always wary of taking too instant dislike to film look at it month later and you might see it differently or dig it up after 50 years in different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere it came as no surprise to me that found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself shane danielsen artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival aided by the film director and producer gave spirited defence of movie than received an overall negative response from the audience edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked only one person walked out in disgust the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and woman who teaches a film directors this was not an overly shocking film there was degree of uninterrupted sexual violence but far less extreme than many movies most actual weapon contact was obscured as were aroused genitals the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring where the acting standards were not high where the plot was poor predictable and drawn out and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film making on the promise of controversial movie metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived over emphasised and sloppy apart from general allusion to violence any deeper meaning is unclear and the fig leaf reference marquis de sade as one audience member put it seems mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale br br we have the story of an adolescent who has certain amount going for him he stands out at school for his musical ability but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence when pushed robert seems to have lot of violence locked inside him br br the film is not entirely without merit the audience is left to decide how robert got that way was it the influence of his peers why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in better approach to life cinematically there is carefully montaged scene where he hangs back whether through too much drugs shyness latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn several of his friends are raping woman in back room partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen in the foreground of the bare bones flat dj is more concerned that the girl screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman ultimately he is bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows rape is going on points up his utter disdain in deeply unsettling way robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground br br but the rest of the film including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable if not overly realistic sexual violence is not up to this standard some people have had strong reaction to it the filmmakers stated intention if they vomit we have succeeded in producing reaction but mostly and as far as can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes they feel why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film making director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision his replies about holding up mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn want to do standard hollywood movie all are good answers to criticisms but unfortunately they do not apply to his film any more than they do to holding up mirror while someone defecates or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt spoke to him for few minutes after the screening but found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial there are many truths one aspect of art is to educate another to entertain another to inspire had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach one of the many great names he takes in vain without going so far as to admit any agenda himself he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for new director or else disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work br br andy warhol could paint tin of soup and it was art clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries sadly his ability at the moment only extends to making high sounding excuses for publicity seeking film &#39;,
 &#39; had heard good things about this film and was you guessed it bit disappointed reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good surprisingly confident at young age really all the small cast are quite solid in their simple 50s american setting the reason didn rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end the grief shown by the older sister didn seem so real and this pulled me out of the film bit perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot or perhaps the film needed to be bit longer maureen character is quite underdeveloped think it is understandable that dani reese the younger would be traumatised and angry but why is her sister shown to be more upset because she a few years older hasn the end rather undermined the rest of the film the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met when he gets tractored warning this scene is surprisingly brutal in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock bit well it works it depends what you want if you want the girls happy story of young love that it seems like you re going to get you re in for surprise man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and harsh coming of age film â rather awkward combination liked the character of court though can see what girls watching this might be watching and loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister most men would most films wouldn and get killed br br 7 10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale for some reason found jason london on tractor funny &#39;,

 &#39; this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is one man industry this movie will also tell you why indian movie goers are astute buyers br br amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichã to it zanzeer saw the making of angry young man lawaris was about being bastard and namak halal was about the master servant loyalties br br but then the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song dance and drama what comprised of the movie is caricature of haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into regulation hero amitabh vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent to me this alone is the biggest pull in the movie the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing br br amitabh by now had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies thanks to manmohan desai this movie had good dose of them the shoe caper in the party the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare considerations the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become standard amitabh fare br br shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody finicky character remember him asking ranjeet to shaaadaaaap after the poisoned cake incident his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant but prakash mehra knew the indian mind and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie it was one character that could have been more developed to make serious movie but this is caper remember and as long as it stayed that way the people came and saw amitabh wearing new hat and went back home happy the end is always predictable and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol the age old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well br br so what is it that makes this movie near classic amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of story chuck the story the characters and the plot my marks are for amitabh alone &#39;,
 &#39; the twins effect chinese action comedy charlene choi gillian chung br br this vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for the very fact that was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire movie first of all the characters are memorable contributing myriad of classic scenes charlene and gillian are naturally cute charismatic and humorous this movie was my first exposure to them and all wanted to do was reach through my television screen and give them really big hug the remaining cast did well in their supporting roles including jackie chan karen mok the duke josie ho edison chen anthony wong and the vampire bad guys one of which looks eerily familiar to will ferrell even the abominably horrible ekin cheng was good in this one good characters are important of course because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences br br and speaking of action this film has plenty of it more importantly there is an emphasis of quality in the fight choreography one aspect that helped in this regard is the featured weapon of the protagonists â sword with retractable spear ended rope this weapon in and of itself opened up variety of moves that would have been otherwise impossible josie ho and gillian chung in particular perform some wicked aerial maneuvers using these devices br br in addition the swordplay is superb and is highlighted by two great sword fights â one taking place during the opening train station sequence and the other occurring in the church finale in fact the blade wielding maneuvers showcased in this film put some other highly overrated fan favorites to great shame and truly feel sorry for those who would cite the horribly choreographed garbage seen in ashes of time storm riders or man called hero with the well planned precisely executed sequences seen in the twins effect it not even close br br can understand why this film gets so much criticism m sure die hard apologists for the hong kong golden age will hate this because it doesn fit into their narrow minded view of what hong kong action should be we should learn from the downfall of john woo one trick pony who never learned how to re invent himself we don need another clone we need something different the twins effect is one good example br br this film was so good that it actually set me up for being disappointed at other chinese movies with the same actors and actresses this especially applies to ekin cheng whose other films almost always suck â and yes this includes the obscenely overrated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie when both were lead actresses in film although they have managed to hit some good films when either one or the other takes the leading role g beyond our ken good times bed times house of fury or when one or both are in supporting roles g colour of the truth new police story just one look the twins effect 2 should have been direct sequel instead of family fantasy am still yearning to see charlene and gillian team up and kick some butt in another movie but the fact remains that the twins effect hits on all cylinders optimizing their charisma while avoiding descent into annoyance as in protã gã de la rose noire br br all in all this film has everything one needs to be entertained and may remind the reader that it is precisely this â entertainment â that judges the greatness of movie more so than artsy dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academies of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about br br in the end the twins effect is classic not to be missed br br rating 5 5 stars br br s â the hollywood execs decided to slaughter this film when it was released in the s by renaming it the vampire effect and cutting out 20 minutes of footage which includes parts of the action scenes however the final fight of the s version does have better soundtrack than the original version therefore purchased both versions which allows me to first watch the original until about the 1 20 mark and then swap discs to watch the final fight on the s version &#39;,
 &#39; piece is cake is defeatist revisionist history of the worst kind whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the admittedly fictional pilots it portrays it left remarkably bad taste in my mouth br br in the march 1989 aeroplane monthly roland beamont wrote stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini series few of his comments are worth repeating br br there was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that saw in action and total absence of the loutishness portrayed in piece of cake it would not have been tolerated for moment the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in good rugby club though with more discipline nor was there any sense of death or glory raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country and now we were required to do it no more and no less br br there was no discussion of bravery or cowardice people either had guts or they did not but mostly they did but we knew fear recognised it in ourselves and in each other did our damnedness to control it and then got on with the job br br could feel no glory but there was sense of greatness and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to piece of cake br br beamont was in his own words fighter pilot who unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series was there at the time br br beamont served with 87 squadron both in france and the bob before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest and post war test pilot br br piece of cake is an absolute total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time it is nothing less than complete and utter disgrace &#39;,

 &#39; this show is show that is great for adults and children to sit down together and watch the stories are little slow for adults but they are still good there are lots of children in my family boys and girls and it is hard to get them all to agree on what to watch but they always agree with each other when they want to watch the mystic knights it is wonderful show and hope that they will continue to keep making it all of the kids in my family and myself think that vincent walsh is the best of them all we have seen that he has done lots of other work and think that he is doing great job we wish all of the actors actresses writers directors and producers the best of luck and would just like to say keep up the good work &#39;,
 &#39; the penultimate episode of star trek third season is excellent and highlight of the much maligned final season essentially spock mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet population completely missing except for the presence of giant library and mr atoz the librarian all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon past spock gives convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel see the city on the edge of forever when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon present in the end all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes br br ironically as william shatner notes in his book star trek memories this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show executive producer fred freiberger that vulcans weren supposed to fall in love 272 however freiberger reasoned the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state this was great example of improvisation on freiberger part to save script which was far above average for this particular episode while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like donkey in plato stepchildren play music with hippies in the way to eden or sometimes display emotion the script here was more believable spock acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner 272 the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time mccoy too should have reverted to more primitive human state not just spock but this is forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows the brilliant spock mccoy performance and the originality of this script who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet fate by travelling into their past this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of classic trek genuinely inspired story br br shatner in memories named some of his best unusual and high quality shows of season 3 as the enterprise incident day of the dove is there in truth no beauty the tholian web and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome 273 while my personal opinion is that and the children shall lead is very poor episode while is there in truth no beauty is problematic all our yesterdays certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films give 9 out of 10 for all our yesterdays &#39;,
 &#39; screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in new york city peter bogdanovich is obviously in love with all the women in his picture he reveres them yet audrey hepburn is naturally put notch above the others because after all she the princess bogdanovich probably fell in love with at the movies 30 years prior he shoots her in loving close ups gets right in the sheets between her and wonderfully hard boiled soft boiled ben gazzara and allows her room to sparkle throughout the love connections made in the course of the film are fast and amusing though did tire of john ritter tv styled klutziness colleen camp dorothy stratten and the grounded earthy sensual patti hansen are all exciting to watch but it really hepburn valentine and she absolutely glows from &#39;,
 &#39; this was fantastic movie about two people one young teenage girl and the other middle aged man who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill certain emptiness left by former loved ones br br both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to the script although written by gorman bechard seems as though it was written from woman point of view and at the same time men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie br br the end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by loved one it is clear in this film that you are not alone &#39;,

 &#39; my scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when vowed love this film bring on the coals ll walk over them as well to say again that love bend it like beckham granted there a lot of in spite of in that confession it a bit movie of the week the screenplay is on the paint by numbers side and most troublingly the director commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin br br the film genius is not in what obvious to the syd field doctored eye character arcs themes construction it in both the surface and what lurks deep beneath but not in those layers of artistic topsoil that reviewers seem most often to scratch at powerful sometimes semi clad female bodies not simply on display but kicking the crap out of football do better job of naturalizing female strength and agility than lara croft or zhang ziyi will ever do these are real bodies keira knightley excepted whose work is not to look great first and kick butt later they are working bodies whose beauty is in their movement and self determination and in my book lead actress parminder nagra is one of the most gorgeous creatures ever captured on screen â not only because she can lay claim to that hackneyed adjective luminous but because her performance has an honesty and un bookish intelligence that utterly compelling br br the result is film women can enjoy without feeling like they re making pact with the devil to do so as in chadha bride and prejudice the relationships amongst women sizzle with chemistry that can be neatly slotted into the stodgy sweet valley high categories of best friends or sisters perhaps chadha is even right in her commentary to disavow the film flirtation with lesbianism bend it like beckham has an electricity that can be reduced to the simple hetero homosexual love triangle its conventionally structured script would suggest the precise nature of its pleasure is ultimately bit of mystery â and is all the more seductive for it br br oh yes and did mention that it hilarious &#39;,
 &#39; this was great when saw the japanese version first it was probably the scariest movie had ever seen it was not blood and guts it was eerie atmospheric and terrifying when the mother ghost lent over the bed in the japanese version nearly had heart attack was concerned that the american version would be watered down and that buffy would take away from the dark creepy nuances of the original version needn have been concerned the makers of this movie wisely kept the same japanese people who were involved with the original movie on hand and gave the direction of the movie to the same man they also set it in japan in the same location in the same house in fact the japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original the only difference was the casting of american actors that actually turned into benefit as it added the element of strangers in strange land to the overall horror not only were they being haunted by an absolutely terrifying and relentless ghost but they were also stuck in completely foreign land having difficulty integrating into society it just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and thought it was an excellent touch br br buffy actually does very good job she looks vulnerable and is able to convey her fear well there are none of the smart aleck remarks that are so common to american horror movies or one liners that detract from the overall darkness and horror of the characters situation in fact it was easily as good as the ring which also thoroughly enjoyed hope the future of american horror follows more closely the japanese new wave of horror started with the incredible success of ringu we are finally getting movies that actually can be categorized as horror 8 10 &#39;,

 &#39; soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70 and still very persuasive even by today standards although flawed and little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought provoking this film quality level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that personally consider classic the new york of 2022 is depressing place to be alive with over population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in great shape plays cop investigating the murder of one of soylent most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is little over sentimental at times and the climax doesn really come as big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70 cinema edward robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science fiction in my book nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity no fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet &#39;,

 &#39; just watched this film 15 minutes ago and still have no idea what just watched mainly think it a film about an internet m star of cd roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online she murdered by someone which causes her sister and crack team of 2 fbi agents to investigate the death the local homicide division of big city usa is also investigating though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the cd roms which he claims are as realistic as the real thing know wow br br michael madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him he in the film for about 15 minutes and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason won even explain the ending because quite frankly can make it out myself but before the final scene we re treated to 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film honestly they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all br br all in all stay away from this film got it because love bad movies and love michael madsen really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied like playing that game with knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly that for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining &#39;,
 &#39; this 1953 sam fuller movie contains some of his best work and its sad that he couldn continue to get the backing of major hollywood studios to do his stuff the story line goes something like this tough hard broad read prostitute is riding the subway one hot summer day and gets her pocketbook picked by skip mccoy what skip and the dame don realize is that she is also carrying some microfilm to be passed to commie spies this opening shot without dialogue and mostly in tight close ups is beaut one of the many that fuller uses throughout the movie playing the babe known as candy is jean peters who was never better nor better looking one forgets how beautiful she was and she handles this role very well the pickpocket is played by richard widmark who had already made his mark and set his style with 1947 kiss of death as the crazy creep with the creepy laugh and although he a little softer here he still scary these hard edged characters do have soft spots here and there but its noir and nasty all the way the standout performance belongs to the wonderful thelma ritter who plays moe the stoolie saving up her dough to pay for her own funeral ritter received well deserved oscar nomination for her performance but lost out to the boring but popular performance of donna reed as the girl read prostitute in from here to eternity hollywood loves it when good girl goes bad and loves to oscar them even though their performance is usually awful see for instance shirley jones in elmer gantry set among the docks and dives of new york city with crisp black and white photography by the great joe macdonald and some very good art direction especially good is the set representing the new york city subways and widmark shack near the river made at the height of the cold war and red scare the villian of the piece is the ordinary looking commie played by richard kiley who is much more dangerous than the pickpocket who is criminal but is just trying to make living and above all is loyal american &#39;,
 &#39; originally filmed in 1999 as tv pilot mulholland dr was rejected the next year david lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie suitable to be shown in theaters he did so and created one of the greatest most bizarre and nightmarish films ever made br br the film really doesn have main characters but if there were main characters they would be betty naomi watts and rita laura elena harring betty is perky blonde who staying in her aunt apartment while she auditions for parts in movies she finds rita in her aunt apartment and decides to help her you see rita lost her memory she has no clue who she is she takes her name rita from gilda poster in the bathroom so the two set out to discover who rita really is br br david lynch has been known for making some weird movies but this film is the definition of weird it bizarre nightmarish and absolute indescribable it like dream captured on film by the 100 minute point the film has become extremely confusing but if you ve been watching closely it will make perfect sense having watched the movie and then read an article on the internet pointing out things in the film now understand the movie completely br br the acting is very good watts is terrific justin theroux is very good as hollywood director facing problems with the local mob the music is excellent angelo badalamenti delivers one of his finest scores and the directing hah david lynch is as masterful filmmaker as ever there was br br is this your type of film well that depends you should probably view more of lynch work before watching this movie you ll need to be patient with the film and probably watch it second time to pick up the many clues lynch has left throughout the movie for lynch fans this is dream come true br br mulholland dr is masterpiece it brilliant enigmatic and masterfully filmed love it &#39;,

 &#39; although have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because m from different era and different country but found crosby continual references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after while and then finally annoying don get me wrong m not anti american whatsoever but it seemed that the english could do no right and or needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way it a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time it the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie have watched it few times spaced over few years and get the same impression each time br br watched another crosby movie last night the emperor waltz and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife who for what it worth is american found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy roosevelt as she put it br br as for the premise of the movie it unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes although agree with previous reviewer that the wig on william bendix looks horrid picture moe of the three stooges br br all in all for me this would be much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it pretty hard to sit through this movie &#39;,
 &#39; some films manage to survive almost on originality alone wonderland is certainly one of those films the script manages to throw everything into near fever pitch but without making it incoherent the speed of this thriller is not to chosen to cover up weak script but rather to accurately reflect the drug addled reality br br as director james cox as very peculiar way of working his actors most of the characters are perpetually on edge and often because they re rather quite ugly personalities val kilmer has described john holmes to be hustler able to manipulate and control no offense to kilmer but his version of holmes seems only able to control the drastically weak minded nonetheless it a stunning performance comparing this to kilmer more hollywood roles like in the saint it seems to prove he is far more at home in gritty indie flicks br br the actors are the main force holding all together there are various little performances that stand out especially the women carrie fisher kate bosworth and lisa kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male counterparts but they are all fantastic aside from kilmer ted levine and dylan mcdermott give weird stunning energy to their roles br br originally put off watching wonderland because assumed it was film about porn actor in the strictest sense yes the story revolves around john holmes but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career basically this film is murder mystery and as such it excellent br br rating 7 5 out of 10 &#39;,

 &#39; whatever you do don stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first batch of credits or you ll really miss something we saw this movie at the savanaah film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch dreya weber is marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the a she said there were no wires or effects so everything you see is really her going for it addie couldn make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my gawd so beautiful was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it savannnah isn a backwater &#39;,

 &#39; m huge steven seagal fan hell probably weigh as much as he does although don have the street cred to sport the frizzy mullet ponytail having stated my own bias and affection for america favorite corpulent stage and screen hero it is with heavy heart that must declare this to be his worst movie ever m not sure he could make movie any worse than this br br in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post production it painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have different storyline that results in woeful voiceovers in which steve voice doesn nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice the editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad gets even worse and by the end you ll wish you had rewatched the da vinci code instead yes it that bad br br after this don know what to expect from steve my friends still laugh at me for listening to his cds is it time start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty logs if you are tempted to watch this movie rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this &#39;,
 &#39; much praise has been lavished upon farscape but don think it that good it certainly has distinctive look but it lacks just about everything else story purpose direction excitement you name it m big sci fi fan and make it point to watch all the sci fi shows can ve almost finished the four seasons of farscape and at this point m not very satisfied the show does have few good things most notably claudia black who sadly missing from the first few episodes of season four but they are very few and very far between as whole the show is marred by lot of very silly stuff such as fantasy elements rather than sf ditto and many many episodes esp in season four are unspeakably messy and very poorly structured and one just feels that it isn going anywhere it mostly just non directional adventures with thin long running plot lines which develop painstakingly slowly well sometimes it a little bit tighter but it only lasts for very few episodes at time br br effects wise there are few impressive things here and there esp out in space occasionally but the show seems stuck in the same style of effects which frankly gets old fast outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show great deal and ve come to prefer by far the episodes where regular human looking characters are the focus br br think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and intriguing and interesting figures on the show they succeed in being convincingly alien culture despite their all human appearance there are few really cool episodes with them esp in the first season iirc where crichton masquerades as peacekeeper captain and invades and eventually destroys one of their secret bases such episodes can reach rating of 8 out of 10 but cannot award the show as whole more than 4 rating br br aside from the peacekeepers which themselves are somewhat too single mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to be really nuanced the show simply doesn offer anything important or significant that you need to know or want to see otoh it does contain few good ideas and is not total loss br br this is just my opinion of course but as seasoned sci fi fan think it counts for something and may be of help to others there aren a lot of good sci fi shows out there but star trek any series and especially the new battlestar galactica are definitely better than farscape but if you re huge fan of mediocre sci fi shows you may well like farscape too br br my rating 4 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; when saw commercials for this was thinking no what has nick at nite done because it was taking up fresh prince slots well still love the fresh prince but george lopez is surprisingly good show love how not stereotypical benny is carmen is pretty good character its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes feel bad for the guy who plays max he looks much younger then he actually is but max is fun character and acted well and yeah angie is little stereotypical but she has her funny moments ha ha george does have big head nah but he can be really good too funny show it definitely should be on more often then home improvement &#39;,
 &#39; caught evening in the cinema with lady friend evening is chick flick with no apologies for being such but can say with some relief that it not so infused with estrogen that it painful for red blooded male to watch except for single instance at the very end of the movie watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self indulgent melodrama ladies for their part will absolutely love this movie br br ann lord is elderly bed ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side discomfited by the memories of her past ann suddenly calls out man name her daughters have never heard before harris while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother strong urge to recall and redress her ill fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris and in doing so lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with br br both ann and her two daughters one married with children one serial commitophobe struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists and perhaps more importantly if true love can endure the test of time are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters br br the cinematography for evening is interesting most of the film is spent in ann mind as she recalls the past and for that reason think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed to give everyone an ethereal glow and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real but occurred in the past claire danes is beautiful appearing to be really really tall though just 5 5 in reality and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test br br you can really talk trash about the cast which leads off with claire danes and doesn let up from there vanessa redgrave patrick wilson meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film br br can really say anything negative about this film at all though hugh dancy struggle to have his character emerge from utter one dimensionality is in the end total loss playing the spoiled lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn offer much in the way of character exploration he had his orders and stuck to them br br in the end gentlemen your lady friend will most certainly weep and while you ll likely not feel nearly as affected the evening will definitely not be waste for the time spent watching evening catch it in theatres or grab it as rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick it ll be your little secret that this viewing didn really cost you much at all &#39;,
 &#39; only reason have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars must admit that was less than impressed with this film in this sequel cruella devil by the way glen close pulls off this role very well is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away from that point we only wait until she starts having crises soon enough she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur apart from glen close found all cast quite silly but from child eye funny that is fair enough as its target market is assume children under 12 quite good entertainment for children and families but didn do much for me out of &#39;,

 &#39; love aaron carter but even expected pop star to be predictable but was so wrong aaron carter was really funny in it and great actor also the actress who played jane was brilliant actress every one who no who watched it loved it br br the music in it was also really good br br the my favourite lines from the film is you cant send me to public school mom im celebridee and take your time it come to you br br although the endings kind of cheesy all the good chick flicks do this film is great and proper good chick flick that can watch over and over again &#39;,
 &#39; heard this movie was badâ they even warned me it was terrible but for some reason probably katie holmes still watched it when it came on national tv watching kevin williamson films means torturing his scenarios aren funny definitely not scary and not the least bit creative teaching mrs tingle breathes the same irritating atmosphere as his brainless series dawson creek and it probably meant for the same target group as well before the credits even started 5 people already wanted hug and they stated that eerie love you sentence it doesn get any better as the soundtrack is filled with annoying pop rock and the storyline is ultra thin three students on the verge of graduation get caught cheating by the wickedest teacher in school every high school has teacher like that you knowâ to save their skin they try to convince mrs tingle that it wasn their intention to cheat but this attempt goes horrible wrong the typical high school humor is completely lost on me the overdose of sentiment is pathetic and the acting with the exception of helen mirren is abominable m sure katie holmes can act â that a fact proven by her role in the gift â but she urgently needs to stop accepting frumpish girl roles as said before the only positive comments goes out to the brilliant casting of helen mirren as the shrew it like kathleen turner in serial mom the role suits her perfectly and you can imagine anyone else playing her other than that this is avoidable teenage nonsense &#39;,
 &#39; if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina zudina portrays mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense alec guiness appearance was nice but didn really add to the movie m not sure if evan richard part as andy clarke was an attempt to add little humor or if he was supposed to just be bumbling idiot thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done would call it overall good entertainment &#39;,
 &#39; water lilies is well made first film from france about young female sexuality and friendship sciamma works with specialized slightly sanitized material that is as off putting to some as it is alluring to others the film focuses exclusively on three middle class teenage girls in tidy new paris suburb their lives revolve around big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of synchronized water ballet team br br such distractions as parents siblings work and school have been neatly excised from the equation the central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny marie pauline acquart who is not on the team but thinks she would like to be marie worships floriane adã le haenel an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after this takes marie away from her former best friend also member of the water ballet team the somewhat plump anne louise blachã re being less special anne is more truly accessible to the boys floriane like this film promises bit more then she truly offers marie has the more essential quality for teenage girl she suffers inwardly flroiane doesn so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt br br marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as floriane floriane takes advantage of this to make marie first her slave and cover for her assignations then lacking any other friends her confidante all the other girls think floriane slut an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases because it leads them on she suffers the pretty girl fate of being not person but an object and she can resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her but she doesn really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are trap enlisting marie to act as her pal so her unseen mother won know she going out to meet boys she also gets marie to rescue her from the boys later it looked the opposite at first but floriane needs marie as much as marie thinks she needs her anne is left with her discomfort with her body and desire to get laid that earthier and more real than the other girls br br keeping all external context at bay sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls goals and interactions on the other hand the film water madness which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly luckily the film has sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever present goals and avoidances and just do silly pointless girl things it the offbeat moments that give the film life too bad in way that there aren more of them but sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls who understandably love to gaze at themselves br br there no great revelation or drama on the way but things get bit more interesting when it emerges that marie doesn just admire but truly desires floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends whom floriane always stops before they go all the way in typical irony of this kind of plot floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with marie but marie is the one who holds off because she knows it won have the significance to floriane that it will have to her when it happens it a timid mechanical affair meanwhile anne has huge crush on francois warren jacquin male swimmer but of course he is after floriane boys are not an element that been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor but they are just bodies and faces available studs &#39;,

 &#39; various spoilers follow br br gene kelly not georges guetary who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un french not leslie caron who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance not even oscar levant who more often than not annoys the dickens out of me br br no it would definitely be gene kelly there something about his screen persona that too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as penniless artist in paris content to put off facing the critics indefinitely frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets that what made him so effective in singin in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious focused characters jerry mulligan is in some ways cousin to tommy albright in brigadoon another lerner story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with picturesque european place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues br br except that jerry isn as likeable as even poor dazed tommy that another galling thing about this film jerry is sometimes cad to milo and even worse to lise when he first sees the latter at club he pulls dirty trick to get her to dance with him when she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him which he takes as cue to drop in at her workplace and throughout all this it obvious she wants nothing to do with him when she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop it about as believable as milo interest in his paintings sure he good looking and playful but why should that sway her when she got henri who seems like gentleman to boot br br admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress if role like lise was played by say judy garland she would shower jerry with indignant insults and glares if she was played by cyd charisse one would admire his guts but when she played by first timer leslie caron she looks and acts like shy vulnerable teenager and as result jerry just seems like creep and why did they choose these other actors though personally d rather they solved things by changing the lead when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people not only is gene kelly few years above guetary and foch he old enough to be caron father br br in short think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic relief type dancer as jerry the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles g ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl maybe not them necessarily but someone like them someone who could have chased lise and made it seem harmlessly playful someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that chaplinesque hole in the wall someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with oscar levant sarcastic grumpiness it probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous and it might have provided voice that could sing gershwin better br br all this may give the impression that don like gene kelly do like him he was terrific in most of his films just not this one well and few others don despise aaip itself either it has good points like the art direction and leslie caron who despite her inexperience is rather charming and really does look like she just stepped out of painting georges guetary does fine job and his stairway to paradise is my favorite number in the movie nina foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody but not jerry mulligan wouldn wish that on her &#39;,
 &#39; although this has to be the nadir of season six this schmaltzy episode isn badly written or acted it just that most of us looked to the files for taut gripping horror thrillers ending without easy answers and moving toward dark but fathomable conspiracies season 6 gave us stream of tongue in cheek comedies that undermined the show continuity and frankly made simpsons halloween specials look like great thriller tv br br in this episode victoria jackson of snl fame plays the long suffering girlfriend of man who sets himself up as rainmaker however her weatherman boss is the one who truly loves her and mulder winds up having to provide him dating advice in order to get out of town br br there some playful fun with the chemistry between the agents and some amusing but none too sophisticated characterization of midwestern hicks it nothing you want to see more than once br br it hard to figure out season 6 files creator chris carter seems bored by the whole syndicate conspiracy story arc and abandons responsibility to the black comedy writers &#39;,
 &#39; there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film have seen in long time it was complete torture sitting through this film would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture &#39;,

 &#39; this television show is stereotypical and far fetched in many of its aspects br br first of all the setting all of the characters attend pca this unbelievable boarding school with painted stylish dorms the campus seems to have no reasonable rules for instance the boys are often seen in the girls dormitories and vice versa but this may be simply because the dorm adviser silly character that basically bores the viewer instead of amusing them as assume her purpose is supposed to be sits around and does nothing have friends in boarding schools and they laugh at many aspects of the school in this show br br next the characters was so disappointed to discover that nickelodeon wasn creative at all with the personalities in this show they all represent on characteristic which is exaggerated to the extreme zoey is supposedly perfect in everything she does looks grades sports guys judgment creativity etc michael is the jock logan is the arrogant jerk who basically does nothing aside from aggravate all the characters as well as us poor viewers nicole is the preppy idiot who knows nothing but somehow maintains straight s dana was the tough girl quinn is the unrealistic smart kid whom they consistently make fun of chase is the guy who is afraid of confessing his true feelings which really aggravates me as the show continues and that new girl lola or something is just another clone of nicole br br the main two characters that aggravate me the most are zoey and quinn first of all just do not understand zoey character she was obviously created to be the perfect character as said above but she seems to be the most flawed out of all of them in most of the episodes she creates problem then has to fix it what frustrating is that we are supposed to love her and think she is amazing when they haven even created very realistic character to begin with br br quinn on the other hand bothers me because she is exaggerated to the point at which her character is absolutely insulting the impression get from nick concerning her character is that geeks and nerds are people to laugh at to criticize to mock in the spring break episode they did year ago they introduced two more nerds who the characters had to make cool found this highly offensive and stereotypical what kind of message is nick sending to these kids is it don do well in school don get good grades don study hard you ll end up being geek and we will mock your profession in future television series because that is definitely the message get from these poorly constructed characters and it is an awful message through and through br br all can do is hope that nick one day realizes that by putting down the intelligent folks in our world they are not doing anyone any good &#39;,
 &#39; this movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind victrion age story of love and grit the depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love and hate with some very interesting twists this is must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences but for all viewers can say much more or will spoil the experience for new young audience who might just be coming out another fine work for sarah waters it also is great way for sally hawkins to win over audiences who only get brief glimpse of her talent in another sarah waters work in tipping the velvet it is also must see &#39;,
 &#39; scarface has major cult following even now 22 years after its release br br it has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined over the top and all bloated up these are people who compare scarface to the godfather movies it is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc scarface is way behind the godfather br br but it is also true that what scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters the latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished italian or irish gangsters from other gangster classics like the godfather or goodfellas this is one of the major winning points of scarface and strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics have seen the original 1932 scarface and must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake br br al pacino has been criticized to be over the top and loud in this movie but how about considering that that is precisely the way the film makers wanted tony montana character to be he is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute he is not the calm michael corleone here he is tony montana very tacky uneducated individual who doesn really think much and gets angry all the time br br there is definitely very 80s feel to this movie the soundtrack is all 80s love some of the songs including gina and elvira theme push it to the limit and the title track instrumental br br there are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the rebenga hit the first meeting with sosa and tony visit to his mother br br about the performances al pacino is brilliant as the angry cuban refugee he has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing tony montana the most in his entire career and it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes one wonders what scarface would be like without pacino just couldn imagine anyone else portraying tony montana and in all probabilities the film wouldn be as effective without him br br steven bauer shines as tony friend manny br br robert loggia is wonderful as tony boss lopez so is murray abraham as omar in small role br br then there is some eye candy in the form of elvira played by michelle pfeiffer she looks beautiful and is adequate in her role br br the director does go bit overboard during particular part in the climax without revealing anything would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling br br scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out enjoy it for what it is raw portrayal of the drug lords and their gangland &#39;,
 &#39; so this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea goes on and on with tension carey in good untypical role but in less than you expected performance weak direction from joel schumacher match with some plot holes the detective scenes show us the luck of creativity if you don have great expectations because of the negative reviews maybe you will enjoy this at the end they offer to us lesson about morality for those who remember falling down and the family joy and cure that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable s it obvious who is the killer wonder why sparrow carey didn resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film &#39;,
 &#39; while watching this movie got sick have been grewing up with pippi and every time was real pleasure when my wife came to sweden she was looking at the oldies and had real good laugh but this american version should be renamed and never be shown again it is terrible from beginning to it end how can they manage to make it soo bad well guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha but they are never close to pippi may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on broadcast burn the movie and save the kids if you want to look at pippi then look at the original movie and have good laugh we love pippi inger nilsson sorry tami erin you will never stand up to be pippi oh yes when read the spoilers explanation spoiling surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film well guess the director stands for this you are looking at this movie at your own risk it is really waste of time &#39;,
 &#39; if good intentions were enough to produce good film would have rated the turgid ponderous obvious focus bit higher than 4 macy does his best but as an earlier poster commented miller little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often perhaps the novel gives us bit more background on newman so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in america during this time period then this movie might be an eye opener grew up in the fifties and the good pastors of my lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at commercial beach whose sign prominently indicated that no jews or blacks would be admitted it is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm and not just in the south as late as 1964 when graduated from somewhat racially integrated but sexually segregated public high school in baltimore my black classmates could not attend the traditional father and son banquet as it was held at facility which did not admit blacks sadly it was an establishment owned by jewish family the subject matter of focus is important and we should never forget despite the lingering signs of racism in modern america how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were the greatest generation indeed so perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of steven spielberg and tom brokow but in the end as in far from heaven the filmmakers good intentions are undermined by having protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time &#39;,
 &#39; hadn heard anything about this project until saw that it was going to be on so watched it with completely open mind and gee the cast is full of strong players br br unfortunately it awful don mean it isn good mean it extraordinarily bad sometimes laughably so but mostly it just boring its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as us network tv will allow but it all tease and no substance and having nymphs as backup characters can justify several hours of bad tv br br there are two basic problems that the cast can overcome first the script is awful yes making changes to the hercules myth which is certainly not single monolithic story in the first place is traditional but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb and sometimes downright head shakingly peculiar with terrible pacing bits borrowed from here and there and several parts seemingly belonging in different films and truly awful dialogue the dialogue is frequently unbearably bad in fact to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors sean astin apparently now typecast as second banana seems especially burdened by one awful line after another there no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot br br second most of the special effects are really bad really bad there occasionally decent bit of cgi but mostly again you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast have no idea what the budget for this project was but it sure looks like crap compared to clash of the titans or even hercules the legendary journeys and doesn even compare very favorably with the old lou ferrigno and italian spaghetti hercules movies just painfully miserable br br there are plenty of other problems the story is needlessly complex and can keep up with itself and hercules himself isn presented as very interesting character almost everyone who doesn have european accent tries to fake one of some kind which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place drama doesn become better just because the actors use british accents after all but the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the bat br br in fairness hercules was apparently intended as four hour miniseries but truncated for this airing anyway to three hour tv movie don know what they cut but it possible the edits made things worse don think you could make hercules good by adding to it but that doesn mean that the continuity say hasn suffered from the network edits there no way ll watch the usa version to see though &#39;,
 &#39; it was painful experience the whole story is actually there so won go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears white coat at home before leaving to work thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in controlled environment and the lab itself looks like school lab there is this monitor on top file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and doesn even tell him anything about it not to mentioned bad acting very bad can get any worst than that my advice don watch and thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently uwi boll movies look like classical shakespeare compared to this &#39;,
 &#39; wwe has produced some of the worst pay per views in its history over the past few months cyber sunday survivor series and december to dismember were appalling to say the least and so it was relying on its brand show smackdown to attempt to end the year on high note armageddon had two major gimmick matches in the last ride and inferno matches three championships were on the line and an interesting main event in the shape of tag team war featuring batista and john cena against king booker and finlay however it was an amendment to one of those championship matches that brought us not only the match of the night but also now match of the year candidate when teddy long gave us fans an early christmas present lo changed the wwe tag team championship match from champions london and kendrick against to regal and taylor to four team ladder match including mnm and the hardy boyz br br am not going to dwell on this match too much as nothing can say would be able to do it justice this has to be seen to be believed there were many high spots and many more brutal bumps and awkward landings the one move have to talk about however was the one that took joey mercury straight to the emergency room midway through the contest jeff hardy jumped onto ladder that was set up in the see saw position with matt hardy holding both members of mnm over the opposite end of it to take the full force unfortunately for mercury he didn get his hands up to protect his face and took the ladder full force in the nose and left eye this was vicious his face was instantly mess for all to see and not surprisingly this ended mercury night early we found out later he suffered broken nose and cuts under his left eye be warned this is not for the faint of heart the ending to this roller coaster of match came after paul london managed to grab both championship belts for the victory have been watching wrestling for almost 15 years and it doesn get any better than this match unbelievable br br the night opened with only the 4th ever inferno match kane took on mvp in good match but it was all about the visual and not really about the action there were few close calls with the flames for both competitors but in the end it was kane who forced mvp onto the flames after they both ended up outside the ring mvp ran around the ring whilst his butt was on fire and there was sick part of me that laughed watching this may suggest to michael hayes that mvp comes out next week on smackdown to johnny cash ring of fire br br the other gimmick match of the night and the second match of triple main event was an all out war last ride match between mr kennedy and the undertaker this was stiff match from start to finish and was the best of the series undertaker and kennedy have had yet the used poles chairs and one scene had the undertaker thrown 15 feet from the armageddon set onto what was suppose to be the concrete floor unfortunately it was plain to see that this was nothing but crash mat and crowd didn pop for this the ending came after chokeslam by the dead man to kennedy on top of the hearse followed quickly by match winning tombstone br br in other notable happening from the card chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero by submission in another stiff match this was very good bout with benoit hitting 8 german suplexes on chavo at one time benoit was also considering whether to put vikki guerrero in the sharpshooter or not luckily he came to his senses and let her go this led to chavo attempting the roll up only for it to be countered into the sharpshooter for the submission br br another cracking match on the card was the cruiserweight championship contest between the longest reigning champion in wwe gregory helms and jimmy wang yang featuring lot of high flying and dangerous spots some of which took place outside the ring this was match much more deserving of the crowd response than what it got jbl put it best when he berated the fans in richmond virginia for sitting on their hands during this one and at one point even started boring chant helms picked up the duke after jawbreaker type manoeuvre with his knees to smackdowns resident redneck br br the boogeyman pinned the miz in worthless match hate the boogeyman with passion only worth listening too for jbl ranting about miz jbl is comedy gold br br the last match of the night was main event number 3 world heavyweight champion batista and wwe champion john cena teamed up to take on finlay and the champion of champions king booker there was no way the match could top the tag team championship match from earlier on but it entertained none the less the match would have been more memorable had it been given an extra five to ten minutes but how many times have said that about wwe matches this year already it was king booker who was pinned at the end of the match after big batistabomb br br so 2006 is over for the wwe in regards to it pay per view schedule it started the year on terrible note with new year revolution but ended on high one with armageddon this ladder match will long be remembered as one of the greatest ladder matches of all time my hat is off to all eight competitors who but their bodies on the line to give the fans one hell of match &#39;,
 &#39; like others have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the clutter killings including few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho mythology of the participants to the crime including capote himself as to capote cannot forgive him for willfully withholding perry smith confessions intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels believe truths and facts capote reserved for his book which required for capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment would almost certainly have sustained successful insanity defense for perry smith even under the old mcnaughton rule capote himself could never write another major literary work after in cold blood shame and guilt in my opinion he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book drama to him both men had to die for his book to succeed the book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment his actions and silence assured that ice cold conclusion br br capote book is not truth it is not factual or journalistic it is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination what most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of capote mind which may have been the most cold blooded aspect of all no wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer blake performance that actor is the nightmare from capote dishonest imaginings br br so who is to say how the two killers should be played who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to do it now killing agree with the few who see in eric roberts work magnificent performance shakespearean in its range yet played with heartbreaking sincerity anthony edwards takes much safer attitude mode to create smarmy hickok but he is one dimensional and boring with only few notes in his television range roberts is almost four dimensional adding physical weakness and agony to powerful animal body frankenstein creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what not to do like leopold apropos loeb robert perry smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man without hickok or man of his particularities perry smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into world of horrors he fears himself more than he fears anything else in life br br given the freedom from capote death grip on the consciousness of the clutter killings roberts and edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft different and new production of the drama same facts some of the same lines from the case record but deeper more complex with clearly titanic psychotic stresses indeed roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is br br what many of our reviewers dislike about this film roberts in particular is that cold blooded killing isn shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand that is because here we are seeing far more profoundly realistic interpretation of life and death than capote could ever create real tragedy br br the actual cold blooded killer mr capote and his hypocritically artistic non fiction novel do not control these interpretations and performances br br if in cold blood and capote effect on life literature and truth matters as much as scholars say then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth or version of the truth that is not the rank cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of capote own abyss &#39;,
 &#39; fungicide is quite possibly the most incompetent embarrassing pitiful film have ever seen the acting is criminal the direction practically non existent and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing monkey with learning difficulties on defenceless laptop computer br br far be it from me to stifle creativity but actually believe things like this shouldn be made am sure the film makers will say that yes the film was hampered by low as in nothing budget but in that case they just really shouldn have bothered as it is they have offered the world something so dire so execrable that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it br br starting the movie it wasn as though was expecting citizen kane or anything was expecting low budget little horror with perhaps modicum of inventiveness hint of fun and even some energy what got was the cinematic equivalent of used handkerchief br br the plot well our leering antihero scientist who works in his parents basement is seen manically stirring some goo in cup apparently such high level science is the end result of years of research his parents then send him off to strange hotel type place in the countryside to relax there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about anyway the scientist drops his test tube onto some mushrooms and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people wow m getting suicidal just writing the plot summary our heroes save the day by detonating barrel of balsamic vinegar by attaching fuse really piece of string to it the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of small nuclear weapon destroying all the mushrooms the end thank goodness br br that summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound lot more interesting than it actually is it really should never have got past this stage of development by which mean plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons somebody should have really stepped in and given someone vigorous shake and said no br br and those special effects well they re special all right this is cgi gone crazy and done by person who can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of 1984 home computer graphics package they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in sheet kid you not br br one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns la clint eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets mean come on couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off but just to leave it as it is really weak br br cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder shot rubbish the film makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie making equipment br br also think it wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give totally inaccurate picture of the movie fungicide is an absolute travesty of film making mr wascavage is either very very stupid or very very cynical &#39;,
 &#39; her cardboard lover is norma shearer last movie she quit the movies and think joined the board of directors at mgm that was good move on her part her cardboard lover was talky and boring in parts it was obvious there were only handful of actors with speaking parts so they had lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat br br the story was good idea about wealthy woman norma shearer hiring man robert taylor to make her playboy fiancee george sanders jealous am surprised that the director george cukor did not cut many of the talky scenes between ms shearer and mr taylor mr cukor served ms shearer well in the women but not in this movie br br the best performance in the movie was given by robert taylor during mr taylor career he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and when ladies meet in 1941 in 1942 he gave his best comedy performance in her cardboard lover and up to then his best dramatic performance in johnny eager he had busy year think of all the actors at mgm mr taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot also mgm gave mr taylor all types of movies to make most of them were successful that is why mgm kept him for 25 years br br mr george sanders was very good as socialite heel he played similar role eight years later in all about eve for which he won an oscar for supporting role as for ms shearer this was one of her worst performances she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy it is strange that she made great comedy in 1939 the women and gave her best performance it was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in her cardboard lover also it didn help that some of her clothes were awful br br too bad she and mr taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together the superb escape the same comments about this movie can be said of another movie personal property that mr taylor made in 1937 with jean harlow it was too talky boring and the actress looked old ms harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in hollywood noticed to tell her to see doctor so in 1937 she died at age 26 what waste she was becoming good actress and getting better roles &#39;,
 &#39; uzumaki â xa0which translates into spirals arriving within this new wave of asian horror films following such hits like ringu ju on and the eye two of them with remakes and much more coming like dark water and tale of two sisters falls short of the spooky supernatural thriller element so characteristic of the other movies the only thing that remains is weirdness and not in tim burton or david lynch kind of way but in irrelevant and dull way br br its start with girl some other kid with crush on her her best friend and his dad who obsessed with uzumakis everything that happens concerns uzumakis people die and you see uzumakis so okay it ll go along with it m kinda amuse by spirals myself characters don seem to go anywhere but ll play along we find out the town is cursed by uzumakis people start screaming at uzumakis and the point is uzumakis are everywhere the movie is disaster it doesn know where to go except to show you the power of uzumakis there are some cool concepts like when the mother cuts her fingers because she sees uzumakis on her fingerprints but then there another scene where she hears her husband from beyond the grave tell her that she also has uzumakis in her ear the way they handled that scene was just laughable not even cheesy fun there are also some little bit of cool visuals like the collection the father has of uzumakis and the girl with the uzumakis hair yep uzumakis hair its out of context though its seems like it was taken out of fruit snack commercial where if you eat an uzumakis fruits snack its taste is so incredible your hair turns into uzumakis now if this wasn bad enough suddenly out of nowhere there are snail men or mansnailsâ whateverâ and you know why right because in their shells they have uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiisâ that only left time enough for crappy anti climatic ending and by that time was sick of friggin uzumakis uzumaki here uzumaki there sure look around you how many uzumakis can you findâ if you want to see movie about spirals go see pi 3 1416 now there you ll find some pretty cool uzumaki concepts in between the meaning of life and dark city has also little bit of spiraling thing in there br br this movie could have worked as music video it has already garnered cult following and thats why was compelled to see it but after doing so m not sure why people think it great was truly disappointed &#39;,
 &#39; bog creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people get together with little cash some knowledge of movie making mixed bag of aspiring actors and lot of determination yet all without the necessary knowledge and skills to pull off anything more than fairly poor looking after school special in bad way not nostalgic good way mean this is so so quality home movie student film stuff if you want to pass it around to family and friends for free thankfully found it in discount bin somewhere sure there may be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing but it is market that seems to only exist by default because there are so many poor movies out there even more so now in this day and age br br the only people would recommend this move to is aspiring guerrilla filmmakers first would recommend that they watch the special feature making of thing included on the disc see the film crews enthusiasm their hard work joy and very high opinions of their own product then watch the movie within few frames you will hopefully understand what went wrong bored went through the whole thing and clearly the director and cinematographer tried but just don know enough about what they are doing they knew enough to have fun but in the long run without necessary skills this interprets to they knew enough to be dangerous this is like bad nickelodeon movie as apposed to more decent one guess couple of the actors did ok and the cool stoner looking dude with the tattoo real or fake tattoo know not was probably the best and most natural and hope he makes it but their natural acting talent was what was coming through despite the bad movie bad script and so so directing principles if the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors to develop their characters studying successfully proven camera techniques and lighting principles to direct his crew better and if the script had been actually worked on instead of written in week or so according to the very indulgent documentary then maybe this could have been more of film instead it a film that has feeling of some potential and has few moments in it due more to the genre than the film itself but ends up showing nearly every frame what not to do if you want to see what decent low budget horror movie can really look like watch phantasm or even laserblast if you want glorified home movie no joke get bog creatures &#39;,
 &#39; okay okay must admit do somewhat like peter liapis and ll admit this is not the best ghoulies sequel mean yeah it had its flaws such as no ghoulies themselves but the two ghoulies that come to earth were really funny guess they were called dark and lite enjoyed the plot of the movie and even at the end of the movie both ghoulies implied that there would be sequel still waiting lol peter liapis reprised his role as jonathan graves this time playing detective how cute ghoulies iv may not be scary or suspenseful but it is definitely funny thought would comment on this movie and just say it not that bad it is worth watching even though the ghoulies aren in it &#39;,
 &#39; sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations my expectations were no where near low enough honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it and if it was comedy the humor was completely missed the plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous my friends and managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time honestly don know how this film lasted more than day in theatres and moreover can not understand why anyone would willing watch it considering not only it very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors actresses in it cast this review is not joke and honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made it certainly the worst movie ve ever had to sit through &#39;,

 &#39; satan little helper is one of the better horror movies have seen when say better mean the story the film hatches new plot something that not so clichã in the horror genre something fresh but there are also some ridiculous questions that come along with it questions you will be asking yourself throughout the movie br br the film first caught my attention while was cruising the horror section in hmv was tired of all the so called terrifiying hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different the cover art for satan little helper immediately caught my attention as you can see the image draws you in it chilling knew it was straight to dvd release but took chance mean just seen boogey man the night before so it couldn get any worse after watched the movie was semi satisfied loved the plot of the movie it was really creepy how the killer was pretending to be the little boys friend so he could kill in some sick deranged way he actually thought he and the little boy would become partners duo of terror it was great idea to set the film on halloween night this way no one would think anything of masked man beside little kid they would simply think he was his guardian but this is also where the plot holes begin to surface br br if your son came home with friend he met trick or treating that fine you wouldn think anything of it if he was 9 or round about the same age as him if however he appeared with strange man in mask you would be startled and protective of your child you would ask the man to remove his mask and identify himself you would ask why he is with your son he doesn know him you would tell him to please leave he isn a family friend he a stranger now we re supposed to teach our child not to talk to strangers in this case the mum is completely fine with it huh they never seem to think it a tad odd that the man doesn speak at all gruanted they think it the daughters boyfriend but after 10 minutes of not talking you would pull the mask off and ask him why he not saying word br br the film goes down hill from there the thing that got me the most was all the mum said was do you want some cider can count how many times she says this in the movie it like oh you re dying we have cider though it all good the movie started promising and failed to deliver it was more of horror comedy and even as that it fails to deliver guess you could call it dud flop etc br br the best thing about the movie is the cover art though something tells me that not worth the 12 dollars &#39;,
 &#39; from all the bad comments about this movie and add them up feel the same way it may look like the australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers in this film it was very terrible and too graphic didn see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what read we don need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through it like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier for example mel gibson is over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy letters of iwo jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history although could be wrong except flags of our fathers and bridge of the river kwai you re better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don tell it right and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill japanese soldiers just read history on the internet mags and in books movies always kill the sense of realization what they did to pows in singapore and the philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians it just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it &#39;,
 &#39; what hoped for or even expected was the well known stop motion imagery and extreme slow motions extreme zooms and all embracing fish eye takes in short the art of finding interesting visual events and capturing them in way the human eye is not capable of to be replayed so that the human eye can see the stuff that made the other qatsi hits br br just wondered how the creation of the whole would fit the title br br having watched the movie got the feeling that the focus in this third part was on the message and not on the wrapping that fine especially since the message is so valid but already knew the message and it appeared there was nothing else left for me more then half the film was solarized or colorized or posterized or transformed through some other filter it looked lot like the effects your video camera does but you never use lot of the images would have been prettier without the filters like the giraffe and zebra chase you could say that technology or whatever human based malicious source disfigured our beautiful nature but why use these seventies effects to symbolize that at the point that there had been more than 10 minutes in row of this cheap looking effect was ready to leave the hope that the rest just couldn be that bad made me stay but then there was the slow motion slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving picture but if there are no more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames second then there just not enough motion to slow down please record the motion to be slowed faster like was done with the beautiful shots of the foaming and splashing water some of the laughing people and the drill song singing soldiers acknowledge that archive pictures can be redone but had already seen lot of that footage anyway it could have done without it it must have been lot of work to search through the archive footage and the effects can have been that easy to apply and arrange as well on top of that lot of the work was mixed with each other it shows that the creator wasn out to lengthen the movie or to spare himself but didn like the mixed stuff one bit the idea behind it was sometimes nice or even clever but the implementation was insufficient the computer generated images didn bother me that much however out of date the bits streaming along circuits in the first part of the film looked more recent and were nice mandelbrot is always fun the fractal mountain was less was pleased to hear cello playing major role in the music little less vibrato at certain moments would have been appropriate with glass music but that a matter of taste as is all of the above of course do hope that there will be another qatsi story to tell soon where computer imagery will have less significant role and that will inspire somebody to get into the field again br br &#39;,
 &#39; not the best of the lone star series but it moves along quickly with good performances br br introduced as singin sandy in the main title john wayne as singing cowboy isn successful you never even see front close up of him while he singing the actual singer is the director son bill bradley who warbles away sounding like many popular singers of the day such as hutch or joseph wagstaff br br the film features cecilia parker also seen in the lost jungle serial tombstone canyon and as older sister marian in the andy hardy movies doing her best katherine hepburn really they mustn really m not al st john before he literally became fuzzy filling all his available screen time with his characteristic business of hat flipping head and chin scratching grimacing and gawky physical gestures and movements george pre gabby hayes as gentle pipe smoking father and forrest taylor minor vet of 395 movies and tv shows playing the oily villain with string bow tie and prop cigar br br fun or odd moments yakima canutt great under the stagecoach trick the gay scene when singin sandy ties bert and elmer together face to face drags them roped to his horse and dumps them at kincaid office where kincaid says you re fine pair of lovebirds denton rapturous comment after an atrocious song and guitar playing performance by sandy ummm could listen to that all night kincaid reply we won go into that after being told by rancher you ve got the soul of snake and of course he utters the immortal ve made denton an offer he can refuse br br the plot of the movie is saved by sandy tricking kincaid and later saying the three magic words in many of these films m from washington fdr has saved us from the depression is that why the villains are always either bankers or in real estate br br the shootout sequence is taken from the earlier bradbury film man from hell edges 1932 all of the lone star westerns are special because of their unique mixture of interesting characters the troupe of actors and stunt people and the spin on the clichã and repetitive back stories and situations this one ranks little low marred by the inappropriate and mis used singing cowboy gimmick ll give it 4 &#39;,
 &#39; the love letter is somewhat pleasant very very low key romantic comedy in which the use of just the right few words in mysterious love letter unlocks the secret passions and longings of sleepy sea side town inhabitants br br it not for all audiences the love letter feel benefits from it simple and quiet tone never intentionally wacky and phony like most romantic comedies it quaint picturesque and comfy however for these exact same reasons many viewers will be bored and disinterested br br the cast is nice it great to see tom selleck again and is such an underplayed role and it hard to believe this is the same kate capshaw we met 15 years ago in indiana jones and the temple of doom she quite naturally good here improving in every role ve seen her in since grating on indy nerves and is it possible capshaw is just getting lovelier and lovelier with age what is it about that spielberg br br it doesn amount to much but after another noisy summer movie season ll probably look back with brief fondness for this light as feather romance &#39;,
 &#39; may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news everything is already happened great tsunami looms over city bay and cut no more to see tokay suffers large earthquake did anyone see more than the 5 seconds saw if you want to make love story make love story but if you want to use disaster movie title do please be kind enough to show me the disaster pd after watching this movie watch jishin retto or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings collapsing that did not get chance to do in this movie don take me wrong love disaster movies and love the original nihon chimbotsu and jishin retto even like the latest poseidon not to much of story there but very good and graphic disaster sequence new nihon chimbotsu looses the point as many times as pearl harbour or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly know must sound like sadistic freak however did go to see love actually when felt like going to see romantic film grrrrrrr even kimpachi sensei makes me cry and this movie didn there is also tv series called napping chimbotsu made in 1975 have on dvd and it is much better &#39;,
 &#39; in cold blood has to be ranked as first rate movie making even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe but film noir fans should definitely find this one gripping piece of work based as it is on true life crime spree br br it opens with quincy jones music under the credits and starkly dramatic views of highway bus heading toward kansas city effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end the w photography of conrad hall does superb job right from the start br br also clear from the start robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors they do great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill ever see millionaire fry in the electric hair hell no there are two kinds of rules in this world one for the rich and one for the poor says wilson taking swig of alcohol behind the wheel br br both are destined to cross the path of farm family showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind br br blake reminiscing about movies and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico says remember bogart in treasure of the sierra madre an ironic moment because blake himself was in the film as little boy selling lottery tickets got you pegged for natural born killer wilson tells blake br br john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case discovering that all four family members were tied up shot in the head and one had his throat cut don people around here lock doors asks paul stewart they will tonight is the terse reply br br after the murders the killers discover that there was no big fat safe in the wall like their prison informant told them so in the end it was truly stupid senseless crime the question is why did they do it and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth it takes an hour and half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the interrogation br br it these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they ve made numerous mistakes and left living witness the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end it makes no sense blake tells forsythe mr cutter was very nice gentleman thought so right up until the time cut his throat the screenplay by richard brooks is concise and to the point and so is his direction br br summing up brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on crime spree that made no sense then or now for mere 43 chilling &#39;,
 &#39; people like me will tear this movie apart it just not realistic the plot is sooooooo predictable you can anticipate everything that happens convientantly of course they find the treasure and become filthy rich and trick the bad guy we ve seen it million times before the writers of this movie must think that the majority of the movie going public is stupid they must be right because the majority of people actually liked this film mean solving riddles in matter of seconds the secret treasure room hidden under the manhattan subway you think with all the work that gone on in new york underground that room would have been discovered before and all that was constructed during the civil war please and the love story between ben and abigail how cute and thought the romance in clive cussler novels was weak they just fall in love like that in 2 seconds whatever d be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper 1 10 garbage &#39;,
 &#39; was totally surprised just how good this movie actually is because when first saw it was only mildly amused must say however that am still very disappointed that donald connor wasn given bigger and better role he was an enormous talent br br there is great chemistry among all the main cast members and matthau has never been funnier br br am tremendously glad that this picture got made because we get to see lemmon and matthau team up for the very last time in vehicle that puts their talent to great use brent spiner proves that data from star trek the next geeration is not the only good character he can play br br the storyline is really quite simple but the comedy and the characters work really well and laughed heartily throughout this movie and highly recommend it &#39;,
 &#39; the oddly named vera ellen was to movie dancing what sonja henie was to movie ice skating blonde girlish always delightful to watch but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material when watch vera ellen sexy apache dance with gene kelly in words and music can help noticing that her blouse yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes seems to be made out of the south vietnam flag for some reason the very american vera ellen starred in two musicals made several years apart set in edinburgh city not noted for its tap dancers let be happy and happy go lovely br br in the latter cesar romero plays an american impresario who for some reason is staging musical in edinburgh there a vague attempt to link this show to the edinburgh festival which is nonsense the festival is not showcase for splashy leg shows we also see couple of stock shots of the royal mile apart from few highland accents there absolutely no attempt to convey scottish atmosphere in this movie the funniest gag occurs at the very beginning when we learn that the title of romero show is frolics to you this is cheeky pun that britons will get and yanks won br br vera ellen is as usual cute and appealing and an impressive dancer but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad the plot mistaken identity between magnate david niven and reporter gordon jackson is brainless though no more so than the plots of several dozen hollywood musicals romero is less annoying than usual here probably because for once he isn required to convince us that he interested in bedding the heroine br br the single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of bobby howes the father of sally ann howes was major star of west end stage musicals his wistful rendition of she my lovely was big hit in britain in 1937 here he shows up in several scenes as romero dogsbody but never has chance to participate in musical number nor even any real comedy it absolutely criminal that this movie with title containing the word lovely sure to evoke howes greatest hit would cast major british musical star but give him nothing to do br br the delightful character actress ambrosine phillpotts whom worked with once shines in one restaurant sequence and there a glimpse of the doomed beauty kay kendall as vera ellen confidante somebody named diane hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices ve ever heard it sounds like an attempt to imitate joan greenwood and glynis johns both at the same go but doesn match either val guest has story credit but this movie doesn come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies the colour photography is wretched though realise that postwar britain could not afford hollywood process work happy go lovely is at utmost best pleasant time waster with waster being the operative word ll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 &#39;,
 &#39; once watched the tenant and interpreted it as horror movie it uses many of the tropes of the genre the sinister apartment suspicious neighbors apparitions mysteries hallucinations the life of the hero trelkovsky seemed surrounded by evil secret forces trying to drive him mad br br last time watched it challenged this initial interpretation if this movie is horror movie it only horror in the sense that kafka novel is horror in fact this movie can be understood on literal level as lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any external influence br br polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness repulsion which don particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me rosemary baby in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces and the tenant which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema br br trelkovsky is young man who rents an apartment in which woman killed herself he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her he wears her clothes puts on makeup talks like her but is he being possessed by spirit or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him it this hesitation between what is real and imaginary and which polanski never resolves that makes this such fascinating movie many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes and it up to the viewer to decide what to believe in br br although this is not my favorite polanski movie it is nevertheless good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms and technically speaking it a marvel too suffice to say he collaborates with film composer philippe sarde and legendary director of photography sven nykvist bergman dp in the making of this movie slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy but it an experience nevertheless &#39;,
 &#39; demi and woody are married but they re poor they meet robert redford and he really rich he takes fancy to demi and since he a gambling man he makes the couple an indecent proposal one million dollars for night with the little woman br br at this point you need watch no more of the film because you can put the details together in your sleep of course demi is going to accept the offer if she doesn there no first half of the movie of course it will affect demi and woody marriage if it doesn there no second half of the movie and of course everything will turn out okay by the time the credits roll if it doesn there no happy ending for the sake of box office br br the absolute best thing you can say about indecent proposal is that demi moore looks good in black dress as for the rest the script is incompetent the direction amateurish the performances negligible suspect redford moore and harrelson blush and change the subject every time the film is mentioned do them and more importantly yourself favor unless some one offers you million miss it br br gary taylor aka gft amazon reviewer &#39;,
 &#39; the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood have read and re read them more times than can count over the last 35 years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that love so much to say was disappointed with this film would be great understatement br br if you have never read the book i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costs br br found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek engle said of the film expected it to be bad and it is br br like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind &#39;,
 &#39; must warn you there are some spoilers in it but to start it off got spanish judges on february think it was mention it was the last copy but as see it wasn back ordered but either way have it thought it was good wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor matthew lillard m surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending man what good actor br br the story it about con artist known as jack matthew lillard who claims to have merchandises called the spanish judges if you don know what spanish judges are or haven seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read won even say what they are figure it would be big twist of no one knew what it was he needs protection so he hires couple who are also crooks max and jamie vincent onofrio and valeria golino as well as crook that goes by the name of piece mark boone junior he has girlfriend who won even tell anyone her name because she from mars as she said so they mainly jack call her mars girl everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game game that involves some lust lies and betrayal br br there was some over acting in it matt and valeria as well as tamara were not one of them there were some scenes they could ve done better and the score could ve been little better as well some of the score was actually good the theme they used for the beginning and the end before the credits was good song choice that my opinion the fight scene in the end could ve been little longer and little more violent but what can you do one more comment on matt damn he plays smooth slick con man br br know this is review but need to make correction towards necro one of the reviewers valeria golino is not newcomer according to this site she has been acting since 1983 to me and hopefully to others she is well known as charlie sheen italian love interest in both the hot shots movies but good review br br although think it one of the rare films ve seen and it really good which is why gave it 10 stars above will give the grade of what thought when first saw it br br 8 10 &#39;,
 &#39; not the best of the films to be watched nowadays read lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there single moment of fright expected it to horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be good movie to watch in the 80 but not for the 21st century &#39;,
